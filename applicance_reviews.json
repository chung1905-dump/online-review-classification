The first time I used it, I did not have cooking spray or shortening on hand, so I brushed it with a teeny bit of margarine before pouring the first waffle, and none of the 5 waffles I made after that stuck at all.  This iron makes thicker waffles than I was used to with my mother's 30 year old waffle iron.  Because they're thicker, they're more moist in the center, and they also take a tiny bit longer to cook (3-4 mins as opposed to the 2 1/2 I was used to).Overall, this is a great waffle iron, and I highly recommend it for any cook on a budget.",

        "Review": "After seeing Montel Williams demonstate the Living Well Blender we decided to give it a try and immediately called to order one. We were so impressed by Montel's info-mercial that we let the sales person on line talk us into a second unit for half price ($100.00). Unfortunatly we decided not to use the unit right away and let both of them sit in a closet for over a year while we decided  what to do with the second unit and waited patiently for our 25 plus year old blender to break down. It is still working today, 11/15/2012. We finally decided to give the unit away to a very close friend who needed a new blender. It worked well for him for about 2 months and then the blades seized up. There is absolutley no way to repair such a problem and the replacement top is about $80.00.  About a month ago we started using our Living Well blender and already the blades, which are a sealed part of the top container, began leaking oil or grease. I expect this unit to seize up just about any day and when it does the whole unit goes into the trash. In adddition the gear shaft from the motor appears loose. When working this unit is very noisy and doesn't break down ice nearly as well as shown on TV.  After paying high shipping costs for the units our out of pocket expense was very close to $400.00. One of the worst purchases I have ever made. Our warranty or gurantee period has run out so I will just chalk this one up experience and never again order any such item from Montel or anyone else on TV.Ken W.",

Great stainless - NOT!  We then bought another three weeks ago figuring that all bugs were worked out.  FAIL - it leaks worse! Being the stupidly loyal customer that I am I called customer service and told them I wasn't putting up with it anymore and they sent a new bowl, gasket and cutter that was COMPLETELY different than the other.  Great, they solved the leaking problem!  NOT! FAIL!  MUCH worse than ever!  The new cutter assembly with its slotted insert and red gasket are worthless.  How does this company stay in business?I don't understanding anyone giving this five stars.  It must be that they don't mind cleaning up the spills.  If you do any searching anywhere you find that this product leaks for nearly everyone.  Given my extensive experience with it I can confidently say that it will ABSOLUTELY leak at some point and then consistently.",

        "Review": "I bought this and an equivalent sized/priced Kenmore model (0.9 cu) at the same time to run side by side. I might add that both brands have virtually the same features in both the 0.9 vs the 1.1 models, so comparing 1.1 to 0.9 is simply a matter of size difference. I wanted a microwave in my pantry. So I have space constraints. Kenmore's next size up, 1.2, is WAY too big. Frigidaire offers the most compact footprint of amost all the brands. You can get far more wattage in a smaller base. But I still wanted quality. GE is far too big, I love GE but it hogs counter/shelf space. Magic Chef is a deceptively re-branded plastic EZ Bake Oven -and just as cheaply made- so I returned it immediately. Oster was not much better and just as tin-canny. Couldn't find Danby in any store and I don't want to order a virtually unheard of brand sight unseen, but it seemed like a worthy opponent based on universal reviews. So the only real two contenders in the same price/size range was Kenmore and Frigidaire. Here are my findings:-Both will fit on a shelf which is at least 13.5\" deep. The front edge of the feet come out to 13\" so if you have 0.5\" to spare on the shelf, you'll be ok. Both are under 12\" which is often standard shelf spacing. Frigidaire lists height as 12\" but it's slightly under that. Kenmore is around 11.5\"-Footprint: Frigidaire takes up less space-Auto Cook Options - Frigidaire has far more autocook options (instructions provided on inside of door), but both have the fairly standard single-touch buttons such as popcorn, beverage yada yada-Timed cooking (where you want to key in explicit time such as 1:42 for 1 min 42 sec. This one is interesting and likely comes down to user preference. Both offer the feature but in different ways. On Kenmore, you hit \"Time Cook\" and then the numbers and then start. A little more straightforward but more buttons to push. On Frigidaire, you simply press the 1 - 4 - 2 buttons and then Start. But you need to do it without delay between buttons or the autotimer function will kick in. So if you hit 1 - and then 4 and then wait too long, it will start cooking on 4 minutes. But it gives you very ample time to complete that sequence so this may not even be an issue. Unless you're reeeaaaalllly slow. Those with poor eyesight or ADHD - go with the Kenmore. ;-)-Reminder beep, Neither one gives you a reminder beep if you forget to retrieve your item. I only mention that because my previous one did that every 5 min until you opened the door or hit cancel. Some don't like that - I did.-Reminder Message - Frigidaire wins this one because it reads \"END\" after the timer is up, which is handy. No more waking up to last night's green beans I forgot to set out on the table. Kenmore resets to \"0:00\" after the time is done so it's not as clear if you forget to retrieve something.-Door release button. I didn't think this would matter to me - but I find it does. And I find it's bugging me more than I thought. Kenmore is VERY tough door release button. Frigidaire door release is quite smoothe and considerably quieter. One finger is enough. Even your pinky. I didn't even fool with Magic Chef or Oster because their door release was so ridiculously cheap I was afraid the door would fall off after a couple uses. This matters because if you're holding a large bowl of liquid with both hands and trying to poke out a spare finger to open the door - one finger won't be enough for the Kenmore. Several fingers with considerable force are required to open the Kenmore door. I'm rather disappointed there. My other Kenmore was so easy.-Interior Light:1) Brightness: Frigidaire light far brighter than Kenmore and it is quite bright and easy to see food inside2) When not in operation: Kenmore's light comes on as soon as you open the door. handy. Frigidaire only comes on when in operation-Beeps:1) Number: Kenmore emits 5 long beeps when timer is done. Frigidaire emits 3 short beeps2) Loudness: Kenmore is softer, but verrry lonnng beeps. Frigidaire is much louder, but very stuccato and quick. Overall Frididaire is louder - but takes much shorter time in alerting you.-Turntable: both have same size of 10.6\"-Time Defrost or Weight Defrost - both have these dual features but you access it differently. Kenmore offers dedicated buttons to either. This makes Kenmore easier-- but it also does so by compromising button space-Button space: Frigidaire buttons are much bigger and easier to see. Kenmore's is smaller - because they dedicate more buttons to features on the panel - but more buttons means each button is smaller-Operation Noise: this was tough to compare. I think it comes down to personal audible sensory tolerances. The Kenmore is marginally quieter but louder if you are prone to focusing in on motor noises. It operates on a deeper motorized hum kind of sound. So if the buzzing hum gets to you, don't get Kenmore. However, the Frigidaire emits less audible \"tone\" meaning there's no real tonal sound that comes from it -- but it seems to blow the fan louder during use. So overall it operates on a higher sound frequency if you count the fan blower as a sound. You hear this loud rush of air from the fan blower. But no motor noise, no hum/buzz. So you decide. I could live with either one. It's going in my pantry so noice isn't as big an issue.Hope this is helpful.I have no idea how long Frigidaire will last. That is my only concern, based on the reviews here. However reviews on Best Buy and Lowes rate it very highly so I don't know why there is such disparity. Maybe a bad batch of units sold by different vendors? I originally was sold on the Kenmore brand but wooed by the more robust features of the Frigidaire. So I spent the extra $11 for the 2 yr replacement warranty coverage.I've learned you get what you pay for. You want something that lasts 14 yrs, gotta pony up more $$$. I'm okay if this lasts a few years. By then my needs may be different and technology will be offering even better features.",

        "Review": "The Cuisinart Blender we got as a gift a few years back looks exactly the same as this one.  Have hated it since the day we got it.  Absolutely worthless for blending ANYTHING that has a consistency greater than plain water!  Making smoothies is a total pain...have to stop the thing every three seconds and push-down or stir the ingredients.  This stupid thing \"blends\" only the stuff the blade actually hits, and then creates some sort of air-lock so that ONLY that tiny portion gets blended to death and everything else just sits there.  On any other decent blender, a few pulses would have a whole jar-full of ingredients done in a few seconds.  Making smoothies takes so much time, the smoothie isn't even COLD by the time it's done!Loud as a lawnmower, and the base is made of such cheap, lightweight plastic that it's unstable on the counter with the glass jar attached. The glass jar is the ONLY good thing about it, but even IT'S a pain to clean.  And the so-called \"smartpower\" feature is absolutely worthless.  Want it to \"crush ice\"?  Forget it!  It just throws the icecubes around the jar and whirrrrrrs and screams...you end up with nearly the same icecubes that you started with.Horrible, worthless product.  HATE IT!This morning, I finally had my revenge.  The smoothies took so long and the stupid thing labored so hard trying to do the job that it smelled like it was going to catch fire...even cord and plug at the wall were hot to the touch!  After I poured the smoothies, I unplugged the base, took it outside, and promptly pitched it with gusto off the deck, onto the ground about ten feet below.  It crashed with a satisfying thud about twenty feet away and bounced twice doing it.  Boy, that felt great to do!  Now to find out what blender is the best to get!",

        "Review": "Good idea but for everyday use it's difficult and annoying.1. The safety switch feels cheap it catches and snaps in an uncomfortable/flimsy way when you press it.2. It is difficult to keep the nozzle attached firmly enough that the safety switch operates - the slightest bit loose and it won't work - we had to wiggle it around every use.  Changing/refilling the milk container always caused the tube to be loose so the safety switch would prevent steaming. Capresso needs to make the overlap of the tube connections greater so the safety feature wouldn't have to be so sensitive.3.The residual steamed milk after releasing the switch was a real trick to deal with, if foaming directly into a cup of coffee or making hot chocolate - not using a frothing cup - we always spilled all over.4. We cleaned it after each use but after less than a week of use the volume of steam seemed to have really decreased.Maybe we would keep it if we only used it once a week or for special occassions but for every day us it was too much trouble.We sent it back, going to spend more $$ on a serious expresso maker with, hopefully, easier to use steam.",

But the Champ is just a wee bit too small to get down to business with if you are cooking for more than one person. I wish Salton would add a variable temperature control to its design, which is a good one. My main tip for cooking on it is to turn the food once as the top plate does get hotter than the bottom one. The bun warmer is a joke.Overall, if you are one person and not looking to cook a feast, this size of Foreman will do you fine. Try marinated grilled shrimp or portobello mushrooms on it. It does a fine job.",

It had been set on convection for about a fifteen minute 350 degree attempt to bake some cookies, and about ten minutes in, something within the wiring compartment burst into flames. Luckily, I was in the kitchen at the time and saw the flames coming through the grating. It was not an area that would've gotten wet in any way--it wasn't even on a counter near the sink. Furthermore, the wiring area is separated from the baking compartment, so there wasn't any way food could've spattered over there--it was clearly a defect in the product. I unplugged the unit, picked it up with pot holders and put it out on the patio--it burned itself out after about a half hour. At any rate, I thought I should pass this info on. It's one thing to have an appliance bite the dust after six months--it's another to buy one that could set your house on fire. I won't buy another Oster product.",

Fortunately, the fuse burned out before there was a fire.  (This was the second time during the 2-week period that a fuse had burned out.)The pot is poorly (and dangerously) designed because it has an exposed heating  coil, embedded in plastic, as the means to heat water.

        "Review": "I've had this mixer (seven quart) since August 2009. I enjoy cooking and baking and bake a few times per week. My bread machine died earlier this year. I was going to replace it with another bread machine when another friend,who happens to be an avid baker as well, suggested I look into stand mixers. Up until this point I used a hand mixer for anything other than bread.I read reviews for Kitchen Aid, Bosch and Cuisinart and went with the Cuisinart. I'm very happy with the decision. First, this mixer does an excellent job of mixing everything I've tried. I've done breads, muffins, cakes, cookies, potatoes and meat loaf. I've never had any ingredients left at the bottom of the bowl. The tapered shape of the bowl allows me to mix a single batch of chocolate chip cookies (which I just finished) or a double batch of pepperoni rolls I made for a party that required almost seven cups of flour. There is no straining of the motor when I add more flour, nuts or chips. It vibrates a bit on the counter but not to where it's moving all over. It has 12 settings which give me greater control on the mixer speed. The splash guard keeps ingredients in the bowl. The side shoot on the guard is a nice feature as it allows you to add other ingredients while mixing. I've found  it's best to use a 1/4-1/2 cup measure to pour in chopped ingredients or flour. If adding lots of flour it may be better just to leave the splash guard off. It mixes well enough that I only need to scrape down the sides of the the bowl once if at all. And just a side note, it makes super fluffy mashed potatoes with the whisk. Set it on at least seven if not eight.Second,it is so easy to operate! The three mixing attachments, paddle, whisk, and dough hook go in and out with ease. The base has a removable rubber mat that keeps the bowl from \"sticking\" while mixing. A simple,firm twist and the bowl comes right out. The head lifts far enough to clear the bowl without knocking the beater. The timer is so handy and easy to use. I used it to knead my bread. I can go about doing other prep work without having to stand and wait for the mixer. It even has a fold option where it goes around one an a half times!Third, it is a breeze to clean! Everything, the mat, paddles, and bowl are dishwasher safe! I wipe down the body with Windex and it's done!I use this mixer at least once or twice a week. It's big and heavy so I wouldn't recommend hauling it out from under your cupboards. Mine has a permanent home on the counter. I don't mind, it very sleek looking. Even my friend, a devoted Bosch fan ,is jealous of my super cool looking mixer.I recommend this mixer to anyone who enjoys baking on a fairly regular basis. Yes, I had sticker shock when I first looked at the prices but if you bake and shape your own breads, like making cookies, pies, cakes and sharing with family, co-workers or neighbors this is the mixer for you! It is worth the money! But shop around. I paid $377. on Amazon and that was a pretty average price.If you like baking once in a while and usually only do small batches, or if you don't like equipment on your counters I would stick to a hand mixer.",

The second one was still working well, until my DD accidently dropped it on the floor and cracked the base.My only complaints with the older model was 1. there was some scraping of the popping surface by the arm, 2. There was no on/off switch (and my kids would sometimes turn it upside down while it was still plugged in), and 3. that my kids didn't clean it :)Seeing the new model with the on/off switch, \"improved\" turning arm & removable base, I had high hopes that it would be a better solution for us.Problem 1 - the kernels don't pop well.  We have to let the popper heat up before adding anything to it, and need to use more oil than with the old one.  The popcorn texture is not right, and we end up with burnt pieces and many unpopped kernels in the same batch.Problem 2 - even worse, is the horrible chemical smell coming from the base.  We have been using it since Christmas, and the smell is still there.  I'm contacting the manufacturer to see about a replacement.  I want my old model back!",

Human Error we'll call it.I went to Target and found this for sale for $25. I liked the look and detachable base.It worked daily heating water for instant coffee, tea, hot chocolate or instant oatmeal and was quick and shutoff autmatically for 18 months solid and then we noticed it would shutoff early with out reaching full boil and only lukewarm water. Then one time I caught a whiff of burnt plastic from the kettle base and that was the last time we used it as didn't want to risk a fire or anything else.Being a curious sort and wanting to break it down for the metal to recycle. I found one of the two contacts that transitions the power to the heating coil had melted plastic and the heat shrink insulating tubing dried out and brittle (things got very warm at that particular point, the other contact was fine. The one with the melted side seemes to have gotten resistive and that generates heat at the point of contact and hence the burnt plastic. Also possible the thermal disk got weak and prevented and effecttive true break in contact.Two stars because it did work great for awhile but no more because of the burning issue. At least it did shutoff.....As far as I can tell the same basic design is used for all these detachable base kettles, so the same possible failure mode exists as we1l. We'll see how our next kettle does, also a detachable base but we are buying it from Costco, which I know will take it back after 18 months, especially if it's safety related.",

I  use the dutch oven to boil spaghett, etc.  The handles get so  hot you can't pick the pan up without using pot holders.  I have a power burner on my stove (to boil water, etc. quickly).  However, when I used that burner with this pan, the handles scorched,cracked and smelled like burning rubber.  I called the 800 number and was told I'd have to send the pan back and they would decide if it was a defect, but she said it was probably my fault because of the power burner and the heat going up the side of the pan. I got the impression I wasnt' the first to complain about this issue., and wasn't too happy with customer service (it wasn't Amazon).  I like the way they look and they cook fine.",

The batteries are still going strong, but batteries only last so long ( but it probably would make it much heavier to move around )All fits perfectly in the included bag also!I will continue to use this, I think this is excellent and just about any adult will have no issues using this, I wouldnt think it would be a good idea to let anyone under 18 use this because its potentially extremely dangerous!",

A frozen fruit smoothie or milkshake can take 20+ minutes to blend because of the overheating.Cleaning this blender was a pain because the the bottom blade section would sometimes get torqued onto the plastic.As for the leaking problem, I made sure the bottom section was properly in place and secure.  Regardless of my efforts some liquid has leaked onto my mixer. The mixer is still in working order because, while blending, it overheated. This was a blessing in disguise because when I took off the blender I found a little bit of liquid just waiting for enough accumulation to slide onto the motor.  Since then I have not used this component.I liked the lid safety feature but this blender was a waste of money.",

When it failed to heat up, I knew that I had been had by 'ol Mr. Coffee for a second time... this machine's predecessor had expired at 14 months. I had hoped that the earlier failure was just a fluke, so I took a chance and bought another one.  Silly mistake.  There will not be a third.  Out of morbid curiosity, I took it apart and performed an autopsy. I had initially hoped the problem was one of the two cheap thermal fuses inside, but it turned out that the heating element had burned out, so the whole thing went into the trash.  It would appear that the Sunbeam folks who make these lovely things have cracked the code on building them to last precisely long enough to squeak past the warranty....similar to a Kleenex.  They will not get another penny of my hard earned money.",

        "Review": "1. The first leak--same as others have complained: When the pot still has a lot in it, pouring a cup is fine. But when you get down to the last several cups and thus have to tip the pot more, the coffee leaks out around the top and spout, landing around the cup instead of in it. This is so frustrating, you have to take the lid off the top to pour without spilling; not only is this annoying extra work, it allows the remaining coffee to get cold because you've let a lot of heat out of the pot.2. The second leak: after only 6 years, this coffee maker started leaking all over the countertop. If I fill it before going to bed and set the timer to come on in the morning, the entire thing has dripped completely out on my countertop by morning, making a huge mess, including water climbing up my sidewall by osmosis. So I have to fill the thing just when I'm ready to brew. During the brewing process there is only enough time for about an eighth a cup of water to leak onto the countertop. Still this is too much, such that I now have the coffeemaker in a casserole dish on my countertop (to catch the leaking water), until I can buy a new one--which will NOT be Cuisinart.No coffee maker should fall apart after just 6 years, and certainly not an expensive brand-name coffee maker. I can see why there's only a 3-year (\"limited\") guarantee.",

        "Review": "I've just received this for Christmas so I've only been using it for 2 days.  I'll come back in the future and add more to this review, but right now I wanted to throw out a few things.  I'd seen people asking if it is BPA FREE.  Mine came from Amazon the second week in December, and it says right on the box \"BPA FREE\".  From what I understand, the 'old stock' units were not BPA free.  Amazon seems to be shipping fresh ones!I find the compact flat cover that comes with this model to be invaluable.  I don't have a dishwasher and must hand-wash, so having the option of using the smaller and easier-to-clean compact cover when chopping and mixing was very attractive to me.  Easy to wash, easy to store.  There is a small cup in the flat cover that pops right out so you can pour in liquid or add a few cloves of garlic or whatever small and you don't need to take the cover off to do it.  Smart!It's confusing to figure out which blade to use for dough.  On the DVD, it says to only use the plastic dough blade for YEAST dough.  What about pasta?  Then in the manual, it says if the recipe calls for more than 3.5 cups of flour, use the plastic dough blade...but use the metal blade for less than 3.5 cups. I did find this note helpful: \"recommended maximum amount of flour is: 4 cups of all-purpose flour or 2.5 cups of whole-grain flour\".  Anyway, I made focaccia bread using 2 3/4 cups of white flour and the plastic dough hook and it came out beautifully!I thought I might chop up some escarole for soup, but even though I only pulsed quickly 3 times it really pulverized it too fine.  Have to be real careful about over-processing.  The 4mm slicing disc that comes with it is kind of thick.  I will be ordering a 2mm one soon.  They also sell a julienne disc separately, but I noticed in the manual that it shows how to julienne and matchstick food by \"double slicing\" it.  I'm going to try to make french fries using their method and if it works it will save me from having to buy the julienne disc.  Will let you know how it turns out!Otherwise, so far I love it.  It is quiet, small enough to fit on the shelf in my island cart, not too heavy to lift in and out, and it was even fun to watch the DVD that came with it.  It is just a few minutes of a woman demonstrating the parts, then you get an hour of a French chef showing recipes to make.  The DVD demonstrates a larger model of the Pro Classic, one that does not come with the flat cover.  Don't fret, it shows you in the manual how to put it on and off.  That's it for now, I'll add more when I get some experience using it!",

        "Review": "I have had this grill now for four months. Used it about 15 times. I have the infra red side burner and rotisserie. Not used the Rotisserie yet, will add to this revue when I have.First the good:The grill is packaged very well. My delivery guy was excellent in getting the grill to the back yard and helping check for damages ( there were a few holes in the packaging). It takes two people to lift out all the parts and lay them out for assembly. The assembly instructions are good and I took about 3 hours to put it together, taking my time and making sure all nuts and bolts were tight. The trickiest part was getting the doors aligned (see later). This requires some fiddling with the squareness and straightness of the frame. Also a couple of extra thick washers were required to get the doors high enough to miss the bottom of frame. So after assembly, the total package is very heavy and requires two people and a bit of ingenuity to get it into place.Once in place, the grill is easy to light.Second the excellent: It takes about 3 minutes to get really hot, unbelievable power. Once hot, the grids can be cleaned, then turn all burners down to low before starting to grill. The infra red side burner is outstanding as a way to sear meats before placing them on the main grill to cook the inside of the meat. I found that most foods could be cooked with the lid up. If you put the lid down, don't leave it too long or the food will burn. This grill puts out a lot of heat! I have also used a cast iron griddle plate to cook small items that would fall through the grates, that works well too. This grill cooks very well if you are attentive; don't leave it alone and hope things will work out.Third, the bad: We live in a wet humid climate (North Carolina). The condiment basket started to rust in 2 months. I threw it away. The grill comes with a ice bucket and cutting board. No use to me. My grill is placed in front of a wall. In order to clean out the grease trap and trash collection tray, the grill must be moved away from the wall as these items are removed from the REAR of the grill. This means you must pick up and rotate the grill. The doors them become misaligned (due to the heavy weight of the grill). If you are on a smooth surface and can just push the grill on its wheels then this will not be a problem for you. The locking casters on this grill are completely inaccessible. They are under the grill and cannot be locked. Okay if you are on the flat surface, but thoughtless design. Ignition: it usually works, but sometimes takes a few twists of the knob for my left hand burner to light. It was like this from new.Fourth the ugly: If the grill is left uncovered, a heavy rain will flood the inside of the grill. This will fill the grease trap and then drip down inside the grill. A real possibility for rust on the interior. If you start to grill and it rains you cannot put the cover on the grill until it cools down, so the rain gets into the grease trap anyway. If your grill will be under cover, this will not be a problem, but if it is outside exposed to elements, believe me its a BIG problem. Finally, if you are cooking foods which drip grease (and who does not?), the materials that fall into the junk catcher under the burners will catch fire. You will then have a \"grill fire\". This can be solved with a water spray bottle, but be aware, it's a problem. You can not leave this grill unattended.Overall for a grill that is around $900, I expected it to be better designed and engineered. True, it cooks very well and has plenty of power, but the negatives are too many for me to give it 4 stars.Edit at 2/25/2012:Have now used the grill several times and the rotisserie four times, three chickens and a leg of lamb. The rotisserie works extremely well and food is cooked perfectly. However, since you must keep the lid down while do this, the grill must be maintained at a constant temperature. This requires much fiddling with the flame strength on the rotisserie burner. It does a great job, but takes a lot of attention. The rain coming in is now less of a problem as I keep the grill covered at all times. this is not always possible if the rain comes while the grill is too hot to put the cover on. I also modified the grease trap to allow rain to run out of it, down a vinyl tube to the ground. Still have problems with grease fires. I wonder if the designers of this grill read reviews or care how consumers use their products. I think you can find  better better grills for $900.",

Since then, it has developed a common problem where I will brew a normal sized cup of coffee on the 12 oz setting and then if I try to make a second cup within ten minutes, it will only produce 6 to 8ozs of coffee even if it is set on the 12 oz setting. I have performed several tests using a pyrex measuring cup and I am also being \"shorted\" on the 12oz setting. I typically only get about 10.5 to 11.5 ozs.I have tried everything possible to fix this problem. I followed all of the troubleshooting steps on the Mr Coffee website which did not fix the problem. I watched hours of fix it videos on You Tube about cleaning the top and bottom needles with a paperclip, descaling the machine and even slapping it. Nothing has worked.The icing on this s*** cake is that there are star-shaped security screws with posts on the bottom of the coffee make, so you cannot access it to clean the area below the water reservoir if you wanted to take it apart and clean it.My final frustration was made even worse was when I called Mr Coffee customer service. The woman I spoke to on the phone was very polite, but about as sharp as a pound of wet leather. She could not tell me if this was a factory defect or if I was doing something to cause this.And she could not tell me how to fix it. When I asked to speak to an engineer, I was denied. When I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told that they were unavailable.So in a nutshell their coffee maker really stinks, their customer service stinks. Save yourself a lot of extreme frustration,and money and buy a Keurig. I would not recommend this machine to anyone until Mr Coffee fixes this problem and improves their customer service.",

I too - like all the lemmings here have had two of these portable highway robbery units.  On the plus side, this unit does make the best coffee and has some great features (minus the narrow water pouring well), however for a unit to last 5 months then 14 months and fail at $75 is unacceptable.  Electrolux will lose it's name making crap like this.  Somebody in their marketing/sales management dept should be fired for inflicting America with the Chinese POS.  I'd rather spend $10-20 more support American jobs, obtain quality and get something that last longer then the warranty period.  Shame on Electrolux, shame on their marketing/sales management for being so short sighted in their decision to make a few short term dollars Vs. protecting their reputation and delivering the quality America expects from them.  If anyone is actually at the helm and awake running this company they should get off their behind, fire the idiots that are behind this and fix the problem.  Isn't that what management is supposed to do?  Final comment: Do not buy this communist POS!",

Then, when I had finished cooking it with another appliance and tried to use the microwave to reheat left overs, it shut down completely.  It did the exact same thing the next week.  Then, I cooked four slices of bacon for one minute and 40 seconds.  It got so hot that it completely shut down.  I tried the bacon a second time a few days later and got the same results!  I popped popcorn and it got so hot that it shut down.  Each time, I have had to unplug it and let it sit before I can use it again.  When I contacted Cuisinart, I was told to let it remain unplugged for 24 hours!  I have it 5 inches from the back wall; three inches clearance on the sides and not under a cabinet.The seller via Amazon agreed to take it back but I thought that Cuisinart should be the one to stand by this product so I contacted them.  I offered to purchase a hopefully defects-free unit from them and then receive a refund for the defective one.  I paid for the new one and THEN Cuisinart informed me that they would NOT refund the money for the defective unit; would NOT pay for return shipping of it to them and would NOT pay to re-ship it to me!I had UPS return the second microwave to Cuisinart, unopened, and will pursue legal actions to recoup the $280 that I paid for it.

First of all, this toaster is bulletproof... just picking this thing up you get an immediate sense for its quality.  Second, its got very simple functionality - a knob you twist to make the it toast more or less, and a lever you pull down when you want the toast to go down.  Super simple, just the way it should be.  The toast comes out tasting great everytime, and I have had one projectile piece of toast (as noted by other reviewers)... just dont put your toaster too close to the sink.  Its a very satisfying experience using this toaster, and every time I make toast I think to myself \"I'm glad I'm making toast with my Dualit instead of some junky black&decker throw-away.

        "Review": "My first purchase from Warehouse Deals was a B&D; handheld vacuum that failed to charge...returning it was, of course, inconvenient, but not difficult.I understand that the products available through this program are returns, and that you take a chance in exchange for the savings. When my old microwave began to get senile, I thought I'd give Warehouse Deals a second chance. I chose an oven with the features I wanted and for which the product description indicated the ONLY problem was minor cosmetic damage.First, the product arrived with the glass turntable loose in the microwave cabinet; the styro ring normally used to isolate and protect the big hunk of GLASS was on top of the oven, outside the cabinet, and it was broken into several pieces. Because the turntable was loose inside the oven, the turntable pivot ring was broken, but there w a s no other apparent damage. Finally, the inside of the oven still had food dried on the turntable and the top of the cabinet...and not just a little.What does this mean to you? It means that whoever Amazon asked to inspect the return at their warehouse really phoned it in, and if you're considering a Warehouse Deals purchase, the product descriptions are not to be trusted.Since I had saved a lot by ordering a warehouse return, and since I knew what a pain it would be to repack and return the unit, I cleaned it, repaired the broken ring, and tested the oven out. It worked, and it warmed and cooked much better than my 15-year-old Sharp. At first.Now, however--a month after the return window has closed, of course--the Start button has started to fail intermittently, and the rate of failure is increasing. So, if I want to get any use out of this pig, I'm going to have to find a repair shop, and the bargain will end up costing more than a new oven would have. A tough lesson, but I've learned: you may have better luck, but no more Amazon Warehouse Deals for me. Luckily, I hadn't disposed of my old nuker yet.",

A bit of pre-history: I looked for 2 10\" quality pans for quite some time and found Circulon Elite 8\" & 10\" Open Deep Skillet Set Reg. $80.00 Sale $39.99 on macys.com Thanks to my insightful husband who asked me to look the set up on amazon, I found out from the amazon reviews that the pans' weight was not centered and shifted toward the handle, which made them very unstable. Macys.com had glowing reviews for the set and noone mentioned such a major drawback. I really wanted to buy circulon pans, because according to reviews the quality was exceptional and they were on sale. I finally came across this set (Circulon Contempo Hard Anodized Nonstick 8-Inch and 10-Inch Skillets Twin Pack) and made up my mind to get 2 sets since I needed 2 10\" pans and didn't mind to get extra 2 8\" ones. The deal was really sweet: 4 pans for $60, no tax, prime free shipping and in 2 days I'm opening the box. The design is very sleek, the pans look sturdy and well-made, they are not light, but aren't heavy either - quality stuff. I do not believe the pictures do them justice. I have not tested the pans in action yet, so there will be an update, but they look solid and stand flat on my crooked electric stove. When I placed the order, I felt like I was gambling, because you can't really see the quality from the images provided. Because of that, I decided to give circulon some free advertising for the sweet deal and attached several photos to make the decision easier for you.------------------------------------------------------------4.5 months later.....These pans are very different from the ones I used in the past.(1) The major thing that needed some getting accustomed to was the fact that you'd hardly hear any \"cooking\" sounds unless your stove is on fire. I mean, on temps under med-high (electric stove)...almost nothing. Then you flip your food over and it's burnt.(2) I learned fast that these pans heat up way more than regular ones, so if I used to cook something on 4, I'll go down to 2.5-3 for the same results here.(3) It's not unquestionably non-stick. I fried an egg without adding any oil and it didn't really slide around. I cook eggs over easy and the egg york tore while being flipped over. No bueno! BUT a single drop of oil makes it truly non-stick. Besides, food does taste better this way!(4) Absolutely true that cleaning is a breeze. I kind of even like doing it :-)(5) A few times accidentally touched the metal part of the handle, where it attaches to the pan. It was H.O.T.!! My older pans have non-metallic handles all the way, so I don't know what's up with this design glitch.Overall, after a week or so of adjusting my cooking techniques to this new purchase, I'm truly happy. The food cooks faster and crisper due to grill-like wavy surface of the pan. I would buy the pans again and highly recommend them, especially when they are on sale - you won't find such great price/quality ratio. Subtracting one star, though, because there's room for improvement.P.S. I'm glad you found my pictures helpful in making a decision. Enjoy new recipes and easy clean-up!",

I read the 2012 Consumer's Report report on portable air filters, the this unit rated 1st and was half the price of it's nearest competitors. So price on it is great. It's easy to carry around with nice built in handle area.I'm following the Consumer's Report advice to buy larger than needed unit capacity and run on Low all the time, for as quiet as possible operation.  To do that I have now ordered a second unit to be able to filter efficiently my entire 850 square foot apartment. (each unit is rated for 500 sq ft)  This unit is so quiet on Low - I have very high standards for quiet operation, because I am very sensitive to noise.  For me, \"white noise\" is irritating and keeps me awake/on edge. But this unit is so smooth running and quiet, I have it sitting right behind the recliner I relax and watch to TV in all evening, and I forget it's even on because it's so quiet.My sinus swelling goes down after I am home for a while - a very welcome relief. For me, well worth the cost of two units.  Shipping was so fast, I got in 2-3 days with free shipping - I hugged the box as I brought it to my apartment. I am so sick of swelled sinus pressure.",

I thought I found my right iron and I will settle with this.As I was feeling comfortable about it, thinking that it would never burn anything as it turns off after overheating or not using for few minutes, this is what happened - Was in hurry to iron some of my office clothes on Sunday night for whole week. I ironed 1 cotton shirt(with setting 6) - it was good. I should have ironed polyester shirt first(with setting 5) but I realized later. I ironed that shirt - it was good. Next I started ironing a cotton shirt (with setting 6). When I was in middle of ironing it started sucking my shirt. I thought what was happening?? as I had steamer on and setting 6 was right for a cotton shirt. But it just started heating itself and after 10-15 seconds smoke started coming out. I was clueless whats going on. I immediately removed the plug and watched it. The smoke just kept on increasing. Without thinking twice and before the smoke alarm went off I put this burning iron under water in the sink. That's when it stopped burning. It could have been a real big hazard hadn't I remove plug and put under water. I had other clothes kept near by the iron!!Not sure if this product is bad. It may be just one-off issue with this item and may be my fate. But its sure that I wont buy Black & Decker again. Giving 2 star as I liked features and ease of use.",

Then the plastic cracked during warm up, when it made a loud noise, leaking water over everything.  Sputtered water over everything.  I should have taken the money and flushed it down the toilet, what a waste of $30.  Why is everything that's made today so crappy?  Didn't even last a year.  My mother has an iron from the 60's that's still going.  Black and Decker used to make some decent stuff, but it seems not any more.  And of course it's not even worth fixing, it'll cost more in shipping back and forth than it's worth, might as well get another hunk of junk, I guess.",

They are so hot you cant even touch them for at least 5 min after your done using it. The toast hardly comes up so you have to flip the toaster over by gripping the very few plastic parts. Another thing i whould mention is that i touched the toaster and it literally electrocuted me and my toast came up, when i say this i mean my toaster lit up green, kind of scary. The numbers on the dial rubbed off easily, and one more major complaint. The sides of thinside of the toaster are stationary so they dont center your toast, and easily burns one side. the slots are hardly 1 in wide.

        "Review": "I have a Keurig that I use on a daily basis, but not everyone in the family enjoys single cup servings as much as I, so the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Flexbrew seemed like the answer. Alas, while it makes a great cup of brewed coffee for the pot side, I wasn't thrilled with the single cup aspect.On the pro-side, the coffee maker is very attractive and high tech looking, and doesn't take up much counter space. I live in an older home that has little in the way of counters, and I was able to fit a four-slot toaster, a full size Keurig and the Hamilton Beach Flexbrew side by side with plenty of work space room left over at the front of the counter. The coffee maker does an excellent job with brewing a tasty and strong cup of coffee by following the directions. The hot plate turns off within two hours of the first brewing; before I retired, I often had that stray thought about whether I had turned the coffee maker off before leaving for the office. Buying a coffee maker that turned itself off was a good decision, and ever since when I have had to replace a coffee maker I have insisted on that feature. In theory, I liked the fact that the maker included a permanent but removable basket for making a single serving of coffee using my own ground coffee in lieu of a K Cup.On the con-side: the opening for the water reservoir is on the small side, which means that greater-than-usual care must be taken to avoid spilling water on the counter top when pouring water into the reservoir. The instructions for the amount of water to use for a single cup serving were a little confusing at first, since it doesn't operate like a Keurig in that regard. And while I liked the ability to use the removable basket to make a single serving of coffee using regular ground coffee instead of a K Cup, I ultimately found it to be more trouble than using my Keurig for a single serving. I felt the same way about using the single side brew basket for a conventional K Cup -- six steps to get the same results as using a Keurig, which only requires two steps.  The warming plate stays hot when one uses the single serve function, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, and could be a safety hazard for some families.I have decided to keep my Keurig for my single cup brewing needs, and let the rest of the family use the Hamilton Beach for brewing coffee by the pot. If I did not already have a Keurig, this 2 way FlexBrew machine would be a good choice, and if something were to happen to my Keurig I wouldn't have to rush right out to replace it.",

Once you drink with the lid on, liquid collects on the top. Put the bottle down, the liquid moves to the back of the top and starts dripping down the bottle. The lid hasnt been designed to drain residual liquid back down the opening.What chaps me about this is they must have known this in product design, as it is noticeable the first time you use it. They market it anyway, without fixing it.Also, the bottle melts in the dishwasher, changing the shape of the lid so that the lids will not screw on tight enough to blend without more spill.Dont buy this.",

The boxsays that it has \"Boil-dry shutoff protection\" so maybe it's not a firehazard - \"maybe\", because if their \"shutoff\" is as good as their lid latch,the risk of using it could be still too high. Now back to the lid  - it's notonly that is opens under pressure, pretty often it pops back open rightafter closing - its latch isn't long enough to securely catch on the edgethat is slanted away from it. Nothing is broken or worn out - I've checkedit - that's a design flaw that makes otherwise excellent kettle unusable, asit defeats it's an all-important feature of automatic shut-off when waterstarts boiling. And I think it's rating is still lowest - with this defect it'sno better than a regular kettle you use on a stove.*** Beware: It's not only inherently defective, but a fire hazard too! ***I needed a small wireless electric kettle for my elderly mother living alone.Small ones are almost all plastic - I didn't like this.  Most stainless arebigger, and too heavy to handle for an elderly person.  This one looked ideal- both small and stainless, and quite a nice looking too, sturdy, with controlsconveniently arranged.  It worked without a glitch for a month - just enoughtime to make a return impossible.  But lately when water starts boiling thelid flips open under a pressure - clearly an inherent design defect.  This isnot just a major inconvenience - this is a fire hazard - with lid opened, ifunnoticed, water would all boil out, and then it would continue to get heatedbeyond 100C.  And it would be a piece of luck, if just a heating element wouldburn out without causing flame and igniting things nearby.  I had to tell motherstop using it immediately; maybe I'll still try contact Amazon, as this thingis defective, and they better should avoid selling it.

Soaking the pan removes most of the burned-on food - an SOS or Brillo pad takes care of the rest.  The lids can rest in the handles when you need them to - a feature I really like.  The set also allows for stack cooking - a great help during the holidays!  The waterless/greaseless method of cooking allows the natural flavor of foods to really pop.  Don't add salt to vegetables - they will taste way too salty if you do.  Try cooking corn on the cob in it - it comes out tasting like it's been salted AND buttered!  Start out anything you cook on medium heat and then lower your temperature to medium low or low for the remainder of the cooking time.  You should never have to use high heat ever again.  Try stuffing a whole chicken with peppers and onions, throw in some potatoes and carrots, and you'll have one of the most wonderful meals ever - season the meat only.  The leftovers make the best chicken soup ever!  Or season a roast as you normally would, throw in peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots - the meat actually absorbs the pepper taste and it's great!  I've never used this cookware in the oven, so can't attest to its ability to withstand external heat - the look of the handles seems to preclude oven use, though.  Also, be aware that food cooks much more quickly in this cookware, so be careful to not overcook it.  The longer you cook it after it's done, the less juice you'll have.",

This machine is a great fit for me, but it won't be for everyone.First off, and most important, this machine makes a fantastic cup of coffee.  The grinder gets a much more uniform grind than my hand-held.  The water gets appropriately hot, without burning the beans.  And no hot plate means the last cup tastes as good as the first.A few negatives, minor for me, but possibly a bigger deal for some:* It's a little complicated.  Between the addition of the grinder, the intricately-fitting components, and the six buttons, it's substantially less intuitive than a basic machine.  Not rocket science, but if you're the type of person who hates reading the manual, this machine may frustrate you.* Lots of electronic beeps.  Five beeps to let you know the cycle is done, and an incessant double beep if the pieces aren't put together properly.* If you're planning to program the machine to brew before you wake up, know that the grinder is loud and sudden, as are most grinders.  I'm a light sleeper, and my bedroom is close enough to the kitchen that this would startle the hell out of me (I don't really care about the programmer, so it's moot to me).  You can disable the grinder and use pre-ground, but then you might as well get a less expensive model without a built-in grinder.",

        "Review": "I am returning my KFP1330CU. It is unusable because of a design flaw, and it's one which I have seen other reviewers complain about. I haven't been able to get my Kitchenaid to turn on.I am referring to the exceedingly complex Rube Goldberg contraption which is used for the safety interlock. This interlock prevents the motor from turning on unless the large food chute pushing device is inserted at least half way. It doesn't work.My irritation began when I realized that the interlock limits the size of item that can be inserted in the large food chute to one-half of the full size. What an irritating waste. Large potatoes etc must be cut in half in order to be processed.But the real problem is the linkage designed to prevent people from accidentally food processing their hand. It's a nightmare of push bars, springs, levers and contact points. Reminds me of a Rube Goldberg invention. If that reference is not clear, google \"Rube Goldberg.\" In particular, the contact point on the bottom of the large cover has some play in it. Instead of pushing down on the contact point in the top of the handle, it slides off to the side. If Kitchenaid has any competent design engineers, they were overruled.My advice: avoid this poorly designed piece of junk. You might get lucky and get one with contact points that don't wiggle out of alignment, but you will still be stuck with a safety linkage that has a bucket load of parts that will some day fail.",

They're all good, but there's just something about about a Weber that's \"perfect\" when it comes to consistency in grilling.  I'm 63 years old and I've owned about 20 Webers in my grilling life...the last being a massive Summit Platinum C that costs nearly $1K.I wanted to downsize and still get the Weber quality so I took a chance on this Q 220 and I can't begin to express how happy I am.  The grilling surface is 96% as large as the huge Platinum C model but the grill itself is about ten times smaller!  Unbelievably, the Q 220 gets just as hot as th larger grill and the grate itself gets actually hotter, making for better seared steaks and seafood.It's lighter, more portable, heats up very fast, is much easier to clean than the Weber grills with \"Flavorizer\" bars, and has nothing on it to rust.  One of my goals was to sell by big grill prior to a long distance move and have a grill I could put back in the box and take with me, but I got more than that.  I actually got a grill that is even better than what I thought was already one of the best grills Weber ever made!  Thanks for the Q Series, Weber!",

        "Review": "First I want to say that if you don't have a good reason not to just get an automatic electric waffle iron, you probably don't want this product. It's very well made and sturdy, bordering on actually too heavy to handle safely, but if you take good care of it, I'm sure it will last you a long time. However, the handle is rather short, and I can imagine someone burning themselves on this iron if they are not careful.The first thing you need to do with this iron is season it as if you would a cast-iron skillet or wok. Many resources are available online as to how to do this, but if you are not prepared for this initial hassle, you may be disappointed with the iron, especially since the iron has a lot of little pits and crevasses to shape the squares of the waffle. As a result it's considerably harder to season this waffle iron than it is to season a skillet.The waffles I made from this iron were actually pretty good, crispy on the outside and soft in the center. If you preheat the iron it only takes a few moments for the batter to cook, since the size of the iron makes small and thin waffles.Maneuvering the waffle iron is a little dangerous, since again, it is solid iron and pretty hefty. It shouldn't be a problem if you are wearing a mitt, but then again, doing so can hinder your ability to dexterously flip and open the halves.I took off two stars for the awkwardness of use - it is not a product you want if you just want to easily make waffles. It is still a beautifully designed and very sturdy product. I could imagine that it would be nice for outdoorsy types who want to make waffles over a fire or something, since literally all you need is a source of heat, but for average everyday waffle making, it's very cumbersome.",

        "Review": "My last George Foreman Grill (extra large- original) lasted 10 years and worked perfectly- even up to the date that I ordered and received this one. Now I could not regret more, tossing that perfectly good one for this.  For one thing, upon receipt, I was disappointed to see that it had to pre-heat everything, and it took 12 minutes (only a 20 minute timer on it that you have to keep resetting) + to simply pre-heat to 400-425 degrees on the plates (the normal automatic temp the old ones within minutes rose to). The only thing I ever made on this new one was partially thawed (3 in a package) boneless chicken breasts with salt and pepper- easy enough- you'd think. By the time it heated up to even cook them, I could have driven outside of the city limits, caught a chicken, prepared and cooked it.  I bought this item (off of Amazon- this seller) in October. I must have used it to try and cook those simple chicken breasts a maximum of 5-6 times.  Two days, ago, as I was waiting seemeingly forever, for it to heat up, I turned around to notice that the entire display was turned off/dead as a doornail and fissling out.  Unbelievable. The power source was fine (and no, no power surges, etc), but the 'fantastic' Grilleration was COMPLETELY dead as a doornail - and still is- useless now. I cannot believe I paid almost a $100 for this thing that worked worst than a toaster and lasted less than 5-6 meal attempts. More like a \"Rip-off-eration.\"  In my ten years of owning George Foreman grill, I have probably given as gifts or recommended so highly that many, many of my colleagues, neighbors, family and friends, have rushed out and bought their own- as an underestimate- well over 75 of them.  If this Grilleration product is how George Foreman's company is trying to improve their products' features by enormously sacrificing quality, now (and extremely chincy-poor, at that), no thanks.  Don;t recommend wasting money on this flawed product, at all.",

They are really ugly compared to the Kitchenaid.I had to send one back because the silver band was misaligned that could of caused a very dangerous situation to occur, possibly years later as the on/off switch would probably deteriorate.I had used it for awhile and noticed that the on/off switch felt \"funny\".  It didn't feel like it was closing though the machine would shut off.  It took me awhile to realize that the silver band around the machine was poorly placed resulting in part of the gap in the machine where the switch protruded to be partially covered resulting in the on/off switch not going completely back in a locked position.I realize the horror that the machine could have accidentally started while you have your fingers on the attachment!!!  I am glad I noticed the band was off.  I know the manual says to unplug the machine whenever you are finished mixing but that is totally unrealistic to do all the time.  I took one star off of this because of this dangerous situation and poor quality control.  You know this machine could even be better if Kitchenaid took some Edward Demmings courses.  The reason why I say this is the potential of this machine.The machine makes a lot of noise when it mixes.  It makes this loud grinding type of sound.  It is not a quiet machine.  Also, the silver band is loose on my machine.  Apparently, they just wrap it around then screw it in the back.  You can see the band is not making complete contact with the surface around the machine in certain areas.  You would think it would be glued down.  Where there is a gap, unfortunately, is near where I put in flour and it goes into this gap sometimes.  Meaning if there was glue there, it ain't gonna stick now!This machine is quite big and is not really made for single batches of \"stuff\", and seems oversized for single recipes.  Where it does shine is when you have to double or triple up, but I sense maybe even 1 1/2 batches might also work.  Other areas where it shines is where there is a thick gooey mix with lots of solid stuff in it like fruit cake, even a single batch works here.  Anyone who has mixed fruit cake knows how hard it is.  This machine handle it with perfect ease.I use it mainly to make bread and it does a single batch (about 3 cups) of kneading quite well with the kneader attachment.  But you have to get the dough the right consistency before letting her rip for about 5-10 minutes.  Sure beats hand kneading!Everything else seems to be well-made.  From the SS bowl to the plastic bowl shield.  The SS bowl snaps in solid and the handles and switches also feel solid.  I always admire the shape of this machine when I put it away.",

The instructions said to heat it for 15 minutes at 450 degrees the first time. It got very hot after 10 minutes, along with the underside of my wall cabinet that's above it. After turning it off and opening the door, I burnt the tips of my fingers. Even setting it at 250 degrees (450 is the recommended toast setting) for half the toasting time, the toast came out fine, but the metal frame around the front still got too hot to touch. Also, the settings on the dials are very hard to read (small type and black letters on silver background) even with my swing arm wall light posed over the front of it. I really wanted to like this oven, because of the convection feature, the modern look, and there's a lot of room inside it for the minimal counter space it takes.

        "Review": "I ordered this grill to replace an old one for the Fourth of July.  Ordered it Wednesday and it came on Friday.  I had to rip up the box in order to remove the main grill section and began to put it together.  Upon closer inspection, the thermometer was crushed from the inside and completely broken.  Also, one of the burners inside was without a securing pin and was out of place.  Not sure if this burner was actually broken as I immediately called Amazon and they scheduled a new one for delivery today (Monday).  I just received the new one and inspected it before unpacking it entirely.  This time the thermometer was completely sheared off the grill lid.  I haven't inspected the rest of the grill for damage.I had planned to send the first one back in the second one's box, but now I'm not sure if that is an option.  I am going to see if they (Amazon I guess) can send me a new thermometer to replace the old one - assuming the rest of the grill isn't damaged too.(Edit:  Amazon was not too helpful with this.  I was on the phone for nearly an hour and needed to escalate to a supervisor because they weren't offering any good solutions - let alone any compensation for the hassle and inconvenience this had caused.  We finally agreed that I would contact the manufacturer and see if they could send me a replacement thermometer - Amazon had initially said this wasn't feasible as they only exchange full items.  I contacted the manufacturer today and they are shipping a new thermometer to replace the broken one.  The grill has a full 1 year warranty, so the thermometer is covered.  Also, if something else is damaged that can also be replaced as well.  The process of dealing with the manufacturer was as easy and pleasant as possible.I changed my rating from a 1-star to a 3-star based on Dyna-glo's (actually it's some company called GHP Group inc.) customer service.  I will write more after I finally fire it up, which might not be for another week as I await the thermometer.)(Edit 2:  Improved the rating to 4 stars.  The initial ratings mostly reflected the service/delivery aspect.  I spoke with someone else at Amazon and they handled the situation like I had expected in the beginning.  Also, I spoke with the Dyna-Glo people and they also couldn't have been more helpful/ interested in putting out a good product and were interested in any and all feedback about my experience.  I think they really stand behind their products.The new rating now reflects my experience with the grill.  It assembled easily and the instructions were very clear and detailed.  All the parts feel solid and durable except for the front door handles which are plastic.  This should not be confused with the grill lid handle, however, which is metal.  As for function, I've used it about 10 times and it seems to get hot quickly.  This is with only two of the burners going as I haven't made a huge meal yet.  With only 2 of the 4 burners, it gets up to 500 degrees.)",

I bought this due to the good reviews it had and so far we are very pleased with it.  Design is nice, it's really roomy inside if you want to put larger things in it for re-heating or cooking.  Easily fits 4 pieces of toast.  The only beef I have with the design is the handle.  When you open it to remove your toast/other item, the design is such that you are almost forced to touch the (hot) glass to return it to the closed position - because there is no \"insulated\" piece of hardware resting against the glass where you would push it shut.  For that reason, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  A word of warning - it heats up VERY fast, which is great if you're in a hurry.  Make sure to read instructions on toast setting - turning it past a certain point, then bringing it back to desired toast setting.  It's also easy to clean out toast crumbs as there is lots of room under the element to wipe with a cloth - plus a removeable crumb tray.",

Both of them worked well, the CSB75 works a little better. It doesnt splash as bad and it releases food slightly better.Problem is, both of them started leaking at the shaft seal within 4 months. When that happens the shaft fills with fluid that stagnates, festers and then leaks back into whatever you blend.  The product should probably be recalled as a health hazard. The first blender stopped leaking on its own. With the new one I contacted Cuisinart and they offered to send a new one to me for $10 shipping plus I was responsible for return postage. I suggested that was not good enough and they offered to pay shipping one way. Hopefully the new one lasts longer.",

Moving on and up to Cuisinart.However...............Too many parts and steps to brew coffee; loud! First, trying to pour water into the reservoir from the brew chamber is difficult to accomplish without pouring water all over the counter, even if you are careful. The dispenser spout is too near the body so coffee drips and flows all over if you use a thicker mug or try to fill a travel mug. The view panels on the sides quickly take on a coffee color, making it impossible to see how much is left, even cleaning with bleach won't give you a clear view. If you clean it thoroughly, DO NOT get water near the control panel seams, it takes weeks to dry and restore function. Then, the filter basket bail breaks and makes it a two handed operation to remove it to dump grounds. Then, and far more relevant, the thing starts to leak. Coffee from the brew chamber drips back into the water chamber almost as fast as the coffee brews. From there it starts dripping onto the counter. Had this particular one for less than a full year now and already need to replace it.",

I love the fact that you can sneak a cup of coffe mid brew without it dripping all over the hot plate (and it really worked!).  They did so many things right like a safety on the delay brew feature that allows you to set up your coffee beforehand, but must be programmed each time in case you forget to set up your coffee for the next brew.  It even shuts the coffee maker off after one hour so you don't burn or crack the pot if you forget.  I really wanted this coffee maker to be my long term brew companion, BUT I soon became disillusioned when I noticed a burnt chemical smell with each pot of coffee made.  Upon opening the top to throw away the used coffee filter, I was almost overwhelmed by the smell which not only affected the taste of the coffee, but permeated the air throughout the house.  It smells like burnt electrical wiring and is very strong.  I hate to think what chemicals from the plastic leached into the coffee from the brewing. Needless to say, I'm ending my relationship with this Mr. Coffee.",

It opens and stops at an upward angle so that if you pull out the rack to remove an item your fingers will be caught between the rack and the burning hot oven door.  A potholder does not protect you from this burn danger, only an oven mitt will do that but the bulkiness of a mitt makes your grasp less secure.  Another problem is that the numbers on the dials are not lighted and are barely visible in certain ambient light.  The numbers were so invisible I thought they had rubbed off but it was the artificial light of the kitchen during the evening.  The numbers are clear in the daylight. Even a flashlight does not bring clarity to the numbers so you have to guess the temmperature and settings.  My oven does not bake on the bottom at the same temperature as the top so I have to cover the top of dishes at some point to allow the bottom to finish cooking.  This oven is crap.  I had this for only six months and am tired of having to work around the flaws.  This oven went into the trash today.  That was a hundred dollars down the drain but I wouldn't give this piece of junk away so someone else can get burned.",

It also creates a very nice mist...I am especially pleased with the mist output being very fine, because with other humidifiers I have used there were times I noticed the carpet nearby being slightly damp or with one the leather chair that was next to it having some patches of water. I haven't this issue at all with the Stadler. I'm not thrilled with not being able to use my tap water though. I have hard water and in order to preserve the filters, I have been buying and schlepping home distilled water to use. I don't use the humidifier everyday, but it is still an annoyance and actually I think about it before I do use it, thinking about schlepping more water home. I also don't understand why the indicator lights have to be SO bright. I know LED lights are bright, but these seem like they were the brightest they could find. It's not a big deal to tape a little cover over the lights, but when many people use a humidifier in their bedroom, it seems like something they could have taken into consideration. So while it's a much better unit than I have used previously, for the price, I would expect not to have the water issue or the bright light one either for that matter.",

        "Review": "I've had this \"toaster\" oven for about 6mo now; wanted to give it a full chance before I wrote my review. Let me say I love the size, color and overall look of this product; unfortunately, the downsides to it overweight the up. My cheap Black & Decker toaster oven (under $20 new) toasted faster, better and \"cooked\" smaller items more efficiently. I'll start with the design: it is nonsense when toasting that you must turn the dial past the 10min mark and then back up to the desired time to \"toast\" your bread...everybody in the house (4) agree this is a pain and there is no reason to have such a ridiculous design in a higher priced item such as this. The dial is not the easiest to turn, there is a lot of tension on it and can be difficult, if not down right dangerous, to get a grip on it and try to turn back the dial when the oven is HOT (which you must do if preheating oven first or if you want to manually turn it off when your food is done). The markings (pointer) on the dials are poorly designed as the pointer blends in with the surrounding black knob it is on; we ended up having to paint a thin strip of white paint on the notch to make it visible (including those in our house WITH 20/20 vision) so you could see what temp/time you are setting the unit at. I agree with the prior reviews - my oven does not cook evenly, no matter where you put the rack and if you do not FLIP whatever you are cooking 1/2 way through, it's going to burn on one side. I can't tell you how many dinner rolls we've had to cut the bottom off - and that is after repeatedly testing the unit, flipping 1/2 way through, testing with various temps (if it doesn't burn, the middle is usually not cooked through). I stressed \"toaster\" oven above as this unit is marketed as a toaster and an oven - for this price, it should function well as both. This unit fails miserably as a toaster; it takes far too long to toast and when done, the bread is so dried out that nobody wants to eat it. It fails as an oven as it does not cook evenly and majority of products cooked in it end up with burnt bottoms or raw centers. I'm going back to my cheap toaster oven and sticking with normal oven for cooking pizzas...or better yet, just get a slice at the quick stop, at least that won't be burnt.",

If the oven is still turned to a heat setting, and the door open, the oven still heats and continues to heat. I feel this is a negative safety feature.

I would recommend that this appliance always be unplugged when not in use so that the oven doesn't over heat should the temperature setting be not &#34;off&#34; all the way thus creating a potential for a fire.

Just a hint on good popcorn (I do popcorn Friday at my son's school) make sure you have plenty of oil for the popcorn (one tablespoon for every 2oz. of unpopped popcorn is a good rule of thumb)and make sure your oil is hot before you put your kernels into the pot.

I bought the red color and thought it looked so perfect in my kitchen. HOWEVER, when my husband woke up to find the kettle STILL BOILING from the night before (though the water had long since evaporated)- he quickly plugged it out of the wall, and it is now on its way back to amazon. not only is this extremely dangerous, but it's also extremely costly! and explains the exorbitant electricity bill we recently received. who knows how many times the kettle stayed on boil for WAY over a minute.I agree with the reviewer who said this item should be recalled- it's completely unsafe.",

        "Review": "I have now used the grill for 6 months. I have absolutely no complaints. It does great steaks, hanburbers, chicken and any other item you place on it. I believe that some of the negatives that I have read are due to trying to cook without the top on or using too high of a temperature.The good points;The grill is compact, yet large enough to cook 3 fair sized N.Y. steaks. It is light weight takes up little space and is easily stored. It is fairly efficient in propane us. The igniter is a great feature. The grill heats up quickly to cooking temperature. The flavor is good after having used it 10 or so times (I am a charcoal bigot). The quality of construction is good.The bad points;The first half dozen or so uses do not provide a good grilled flavor. After some build up of juices and fat, the flavor is much better. If using on the high heat setting, I would not recommend placing on a flammable surface. The surface of the table that I used was hot enough burn you.Overall;I am satisfied and would recommend it to friends.Recommendations;Grill fatty meats such as hamburgers when first using, a lean cut of meat will not produce the drippings for the grilled flavor.",

No grounds in the brew either.My caution to potential buyers is that my machine doesn't always brew.  I have owned it for over 8 months now and, once every two or three dozen cups, the machine goes through the brew process, makes all the right noises, but only manages to dribble a tablespoon or so of brewed coffee into the cup.  I have to drain the maker, hold it upside down and smack it on the bottom a time or two.  It will brew again after that... until the next time it gets stuck.Imagine one of those bleary morning when you are really looking forward to that cup, only to have the machine stand you up.  My parrot has learned some words I prefer it not to know because of this machine!I haven't exactly kept count but I think the issue is getting more frequent as the machine gets older.

It makes quick work of all these tasks and many more - I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner! It seems like I'm constantly telling my wife: \"this thing is great! Look at how easily it does X!\" Why did I ever chop by hand or drag out the big blender to try to do something that this does so much better.My only complaint is with the chopper bowl. It isn't quite strong enough and developed hairline cracks within the first few months. These cracks radiate from the mounting hole where the peg inserts that the blade rests upon. I've been keeping a close eye on this and today (October 2013), parts of plastic started breaking off. Since this could lead to a dangerous situation, I immediately called Miallegro's tech support number, explained that my chopper bowl was cracked, and they took my address to send a replacement right out. Really refreshing technical support. No long wait on hold, no questioning my claims. Just take my address and the original order info and we're done. While I'm not happy that the bowl broke, they dealt with it perfectly.Overall, this is a great device. Even though it's \"only\" rated 450W, I've never found that I needed more power. I recommend it without reservation.",

I looked at my coffee pot and the coffee was in a full rolling BOIL and then smoke started billowing out the bottom (and the plastic smell was atrocious).  I unplugged it, but the amount of smoke coming from the base continued to increase at an alarming rate.  I removed the pot, touched the TOP of the coffee maker to see if it was too hot to handle, and since it was not yet, I grabbed it and ran out the back door.By the time I was halfway down my deck steps, the smoke was really pouring and the machine was getting warm under my hands, so I tossed it out into the yard.  When it cracked on impact, a lot of smoke came out of the bottom (under the hotplate upon which the pot sits) and when I grabbed a pot full of rain water and threw on it, a plume of steam and smoke came out.  It smoldered for quite a while in my backyard.  (I never saw flames but I feel that it would have caught fire within a few more minutes if not seconds.)I am so thankful that this happened moments BEFORE I drove off.  I usually leave it on for the 15 minutes it takes to run the kids to school and then come back for my second cup of coffee for the morning.  My house stinks a bit now but that's such a small inconvenience... when I think of what would have happened to our pets, it scares me to death!",

If you want more frying capacity, you shouldn't get this one in the first place.It is nice in holding less oil and fitting in better with the counter space I have, so those are benefits to me. Once getting used to how things work, I've never had any real issues with the temperature of the oil. Does it take a little longer than some other fryers out there? I can't really say because I haven't done any comparisons. All I know is when I cut up a potato for fries and do the \"fry for a minute or two, take out for another couple then fry until done\" method, I'm very happy with the results. Check out the photos I've added to see some of what I like to make in this.Be careful not to overload the basket. I've done a batch of potato chips and I have to be careful not to put the equivalent of a full potato in because as thin as the chips can be cut they sometimes get stuck together and the last time I ended up with a clump of junk I had to toss. That's my fault though, not a defect of the fryer.After at least a couple dozen uses I've found it's a little less simple to clean around the top of the oil reservoir and there's some buildup around the hinge of the lid. That's a bit messy (and I've just used vegetable oil so far). You may have to be a little careful when pouring oil out to clean the insides because the groove at the front left edge is fairly small so some of it may dribble over the edge. Nothing that can't be dealt with if you're careful.The magnetic cord attachment is something I'm used to with smaller fryers and it's a good safety feature. Put the fryer where you want it, hook everything up, and if you don't move anything the cord stays put.In the end, if you know what you're doing this is a very solid fryer given what it's designed for.",

That was frustrating, but I e-mailed Cuisinart asking how to get a replacement bowl.  They didn't reply to my e-mail, but did send me out a new bowl free.  I really appreciated the new bowl, though it would have been nice if they had responded to my e-mail letting me know they were sending it to me.  A month later, while blending salsa, the motor burned out.  That was VERY frustrating!  I read my material and knew it would cost a lot in postage to mail it back to Cuisinart, so I called the store where I bought it and they accepted in back for an exchange.  I brought the new one home and used it for 6 months, but had to be extremely careful not to over heat the motor.  Then I was blending soft serve ice cream and it started smoking and burning.  That was the final straw.  I love the blender/processor combo idea, but it's useless to have the motor keep burning out.  I took it back to the store I bought it at, got a refund and will not buy this again.  What a hassle!  So to sum it up, it's wonderful to have the blender/processor combo, but not when the motor keeps burning out.  Hopefully Cuisinart will fix this defect, but until they do, don't buy this.",

Actually, I gave it to her the night before Christmas Eve as she was going to bake pies and cookies for our family Christmas.She got done in half the time it would normally take her and really enjoyed the hands-free use, and the power it provided.  The splash/pour collar allows for much less of a mess, and the many beaters did all the work.  (She doesn't even have to use a wooden spoon to get stuff off the edges) Needless to say, a weekend has not gone by without the smell of fresh cookies in the house!I found the a similar mixer at Costco a week after I bought this one from Amazon, and it had less power and less attachments for more money, so I know I got a good deal.All in all ... We are both very happy with the purchase.  She with the mixer, and me with the great price (all the cookies don't hurt either ;) Yumm!)",

        "Review": "I had read many reviews and couldn't believe the negative reviews were really that bad.  I now believe that there is a problem with quality control.  I have, in the past, purchased and used Rowenta irons for so many years.  Really loved my first Rowenta iron and would not have replaced it except for the fact that a child ran past the ironing board, tipped it over and there went that iron.  I purchased a newer model since the old one was no longer available.  It began spitting and leaking.  I thought that someone had knocked it off the ironing board and not said anything.  Then I purchased this iron to replace that one.  Less than a week after I received it, it started turning itself off while I was in the middle of ironing.  I loved the iron while it worked, but there appears to be a short in the chord just inside the handle.  If I turn my iron a certain way, while ironing, it automatically shuts off.  I'm not about to completely change how I have been ironing for 40 years just so I can keep an iron.  If you move the chord around a bit, right by the handle where it swivels, it will click through the settings, maybe stop on the setting you have it on, maybe go to the &#34;auto shut-off&#34; setting then back to your setting again.  Definitely not worth the money.",

I was able to take the main body apart and clean it, but could not dry or reseal the drive shaft in the blade attachment, so it was never the same.

The heating element is in the bottom two inches of the pot, which makes it very heavy. The plastic handle is way too big, making it even harder to lift. The floor of the pot is simply a plate stuck in it - it has a seam and rim that look like they would either collect sediment or let water through to the heating element, or both. It has a meaningless plastic filter - says it's to catch calcifications, that you aren't allowed to put tea or anything else in it, just water. The base is very lightweight, made of plastic, and the bottom of the pot is also black plastic. I wonder if the plastic would emit fumes during heating, as the metal it's in contact with should get extremely hot when the water comes to a boil. I think the combination of the weight and the size of the handle make it dangerous. You also have to unplug it after use, according to the instructions. I sent it back.",

I see heavy dust on the fans and front panel which tells me dust and dirt are still getting past those filters pretty easily. As for the \"ozone smell\" mentioned by others, I actually kind of like it- smells clean to me.But now to the dangerous part: I don't know if my unit is defective, but the electrical leads that connect to the inner filters are not well grounded at all. If you run you hand along the edges of the back panel, it will actually shock you through the gap in the plastic! You can even see the electric arch! It's not a minor shock either. I once had my plugged in laptop resting on my chest when my barefoot brushed up against the back of the purifier by accident, completing the circut.

It was there for approx 30 min unattended after being washed by hand. I had not knicked or scratched the lid. Nothing fell on the lid. Nothing was laying on top of the lid. I have never put the lids or pans in the either the dishwasher or oven. There was no sudden temperature change. It simply exploded into little squares of safety glass.We were all astonished and puzzled as to how this happened. Fortunately, no one was hurt as the drying rack was sitting down inside the sink basin so the tempered glass was mostly contained to that area.

In addition, the shape and colour (red) were pleasing to the eye. What I was soon to discover - after I had bought it... - is that the design of the carafe has some terrible flaw that makes it spill water all over the place if you try use it to fill the tank; after the coffee is brewed, it will also spill coffee all over the place when you try to pour in the cup. You will need to keep some other vessel handy to fill the tank and must always pour the coffee over the sink. It is a constant irritation - also because these precautions need to be explained to any houseguests that might be using using the coffeemaker unsupervised... I would have ditched this coffeemaker long ago but for the fact that there are apparently no alternatives in the US market for small-capacity coffeemakers with automatic switch-off.

        "Review": "Several years ago, I had a George Foreman grill. It was one of the older, basic models. It only cost $20 and it could cook an 8oz burger to medium-rare in two minutes. The fat rolled off as expected, and I used to pour it back atop the burger and trap it on with a piece of cheese before it had a chance to reduce the fat again.For the uninitiated, a George Foreman Grill is known as the \"Lean, Mean, Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine\".My original grill was confiscated by the Dorm Manager at Kadena AB, Okinawa, Japan. I don't recall the details of the conversation, but it regarded regulations about not cooking dinner next to my keyboard and eating directly off the grill. Sigh.So recently I bought an upgrade, the \"Next Grilleration\" model. I am severely disappointed. Keep in mind this model was $60 (3x as much, for those of you who are counting).The cooking surface is nearly flat, so the fat never moves - It just pools there. I wouldn't mind this except that it is, indeed, pulling the fat out of the meat. The fat has flavor and helps prevent me from eating a dry burger - That's why we designed cows with fat. Well, maybe not, but my point remains.Furthermore, the cooking time has been greatly increased. My attempt to cook an 8oz burger took no less than ten minutes from plugin to cheese-based fat entrapment.Additionally, the fat man has yet to discover the wonderment of a power switch or a cord longer than four feet. Seriously, who's going to rearrange their kitchen for a new novelty grill? The lack of a power switch causes me to have to reach over and behind the dangerous cooking surface (Leaving the grill roughly aligned with my genitals, though about a foot away) to unplug it. The short cord, combined with the Manual's disclaimer about not using an extension cord, ensures the grill will always be in proximity to something flammable.Pros:- Does a passable job of cooking a burger, eventually.- Didn't set my kitchen on fire, though the thick cloud of steam gave me doubts.- Sleek, clean design- Reduces fat when used properly- Cheap Plastic Spatula and Cheap Plastic Fat Tray are easy to clean.Cons:- The \"Fat Pool\" on the grill evokes jokes about fat people at public pools.- Takes five times longer to cook an 8oz burger to medium-rare than its predecessor.- Thick Cloud of Steam caused me unwelcome concern.- Sleek, clean designs are hard to clean. The ugly, rugged design of the previous model was easier to clean because it had fewer vertical protrusions to interfere with a paper towel's path.- Reduces taste, too.- I noticed a 1-2mm layer of darkened brown material on both sides of the burger after cooking, which was easily scraped off with the included Cheap Plastic Spatula. This was diagnosed as fat which the grill failed to reduce properly.- Cheap Plastic Spatula.- Cheap Plastic Fat Tray.Conclusion:George should have stuck with the prototype - Products are supposed to improve as time proceeds, not regress. I give it a 60%, and most of that is because it actually cooked the burger, eventually. I gave its predecesssor a 90% rating.",

        "Review": "I wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews before purchasing this coffee maker. Had I done so I wouldn't be writing this review. The first BIG red flag I ignored was \"Fire Hazard\", not once, not twice, but a DOZEN or more times (and counting). The second red flag I ignored was \"Leaks\" and of course, I kept reading about this issue too but went ahead and bought it anyway. Obviously the third and most important red flag I ignored was \"Do Not Buy\". Fortunately my coffee maker never caught fire although I'm sure it would have eventually had I not returned it. Within 8 months after I purchased it I noticed that the paint on the warming plate began to chip off and eventually these areas with exposed metal began to rust. The smell of toasted rusty metal is pretty nasty to say the least but it got so bad I couldn't even make coffee because the odor was so pungent. Eventually the paint on the warming plate came completely off and it was just a big brown rusty mess and any cloth I wiped it with had to be discarded. So I called Cuisinart and they said they would replace it for a $10 \"Service Charge\" AND I had to ship the old one back at MY expense. So for basically another $25 I received the exact same model. Within 4 months guess what? A piece of paint chipped of the warming plate, ahhhh yes history does repeat itself. Lastly, it does make a great cup of coffee but it's literally, not to die for. For your own safety, DO NOT BUY!!",

        "Review": "First, I rarely use this iron; it is my wife's favorite, she really loves it. She thinks it is the best she has ever had (previously another Rowenta, and a Black & Decker) but after two years of use it quit. All of a sudden it stopped heating. The display started changing the setting indications randomly and then simply went dead.I checked it out and found out that the cord had developed a discontinuity. Right where the cord enters the iron there is a plastic clamp that mounts the cord to the body of the iron. This clamp holds the cord by pinching it. But the way it is pinching it, is that one side of the clamp is like a channel groove and the other is like a knife that matches the channel by going right inside the groove and it is pretty sharp. So as we were using the iron moving it forth and back, the cord was wiggling, and over time the wire threads inside the cord got cut right at the point where it was clamped inside the iron. The cord looked fine and by inspection I was not able to see anything wrong with it but when I tested it for continuity it was dead and when by wiggling it I could get some intermittent connection. I took out the two screws that hold the clamp closed and disconnected the wire and then I made an incision along the wire. Sure enough, right at the point where it was clamped, the threads were cut and it was black from arching when wiggled. So in my case it was pretty simple and I suppose that fixing it means eventually just shortening the cord about 3 inches to remove the old pinching point because otherwise the control board and everything else are fine.Now, don't go fooling around with the insides of an iron if you are not qualified because you can hurt yourself or put your house on fire. You should take it to a qualified technician and *if* your problem is because of this same reason, then he should be able to fix it fairly easily by shortening the cord by about 3 inches and using two new crimp connectors (if the old crimp connectors can be carefully removed so that the blue and red wires don't get too short). However, some technicians depending on warranty policies may just have to change the whole handle assembly.So, the wife says it is wonderful and works like a dream, satisfying steam production, easy gliding, best ironing ever (while it worked of course), but the above problem is bad design and it is quite likely to present itself given the mechanics of its operation. The plastic sleeve that guides the cord into the iron is a joke. It is not mounted in a stationary way on the iron; it floats freely in its seat and so most of the cord's motion is transferred to the stationary clamp that is inside the iron at the base of the sleeve's seat. Well, how much can you wiggle a wire which you are holding sharply pinched before it gives up? My opinion is that the design of that part is really bad and such an expensive iron should not have such a ridiculous flaw.I personally like the old B&D; - which the wife snobs since she discovered the Rowentas. But I never had to repair any of the B&Ds; (two, which still work fine) but I did have to repair *both* the Rowentas.",

        "Review": "I've had this iron for eleven months and I'm having the same issue as KURALVANAN ARANGASAMY (see that review on 2/8/12).  The coating on the stainless-steel soleplate has started to wear off, exposing whatever is beneath it, which has started to rust.  I was able to get through to Panasonic Customer Service and was told that I need to ship the iron, at my expense, to Texas for replacement.  I realize it's common to have to pay to ship a defective product back to the manufacturer but it still always bothers me.  Unlike some reviewers, I do like the removable water tank and after almost a year of daily use (and I do mean every day), I haven't had any issues with water leaking from the iron because of this feature.  I too thought it was a gimmick until I realized that it really is a useful and handy feature.  I can now let the iron heat up while I'm filling the tank with water, which is a time saver.  Since the removable tank is much smaller than an entire iron, it easily fits under the faucet of a small sink when you're refilling it.  No more using the bathtub or a measuring cup.I will update this review if I have any issues with getting the iron exchanged by Panasonic.  I will ask them to provide a refund instead of a replacement if the issue with the soleplate hasn't been resolved yet.  We'll see how that goes.  I don't want to have to return another one for the same issue a few months from now.03/02/12 Update: Although there have been at least two other reviews to date that have mentioned an issue with rust on the soleplate, I can now not be sure it actually is rust.  Whatever it is, I was able to remove with Magic Eraser to reveal the shiny stainless steel underneath.  It appears that it may simply be rust colored material that was burned onto the surface, probably from ironing synthetic material at high temperatures.  After cleaning the surface, I did notice that the same issue came back again just a little.  I've reduced the temperature setting that I was usually using (4.5) and it has not gotten worse, so I may have just been letting the iron get too hot.  Maybe it is still a defect...I can't be absolutely sure.  Based on this discovery, I've decided not to return the iron and I would give the iron 4 stars if I were able to change my rating.",

I concluded that surely indicated a drop off in quality and that the Zojirushi might have been good once but no longer.  I keep researching and found that all the high end coffee makers seem to have problems, so I decided to take a chance on the Zojirushi.  I am glad I did and real sorry I waited.  I have yet to encounter the leak problems, but at 12 cup capacity, I rarely make a full pot.  I would say the cap is only hard to open if you need OXO or other easy grip utensiles; the plastic serated edge could cause difficulty but it is an easy matter to grab a dishtowel.  Actually, I only found it difficult the  first time, it seemed to loosen up with subsequent use.  Lastly, I just do not understand the complaint that the thermos does not keep coffee hot enough.  I routinely keep coffee in the thermos over 2 hours and see no appreciable drop off in temperature.  I highly recommend this coffee maker.",

        "Review": "Zojirushi NP-HBC 10 5 1/2-Cup (Uncooked) Rice CookerFor an avid rice eater like myself, there is nothing quite as handy as a rice cooker. Sure, I use pots and pans like the rest of us, but there is always a need for a side of rice with whatever meal I am having. Back in the day, I used to cook my rice in a pot with boiling water, but was almost always left unsatisfied. Sometimes, the rice would be under-cooked and tough. Other times, the rice would be overcooked and way too mushy. It seemed that no matter what techniques I used, I could never get it right. You'd think, that with all the rice I have cooked in my life, that I would be a pro at it. But, alas, that is not the case. When I came to that realization, I decided it was time to invest in a rice cooker, and boy, am I glad I did!It didn't take me very long at all to realize I made the right decision when I purchased the Zojirushi NP-HBC 10 5 1/2 - Cup Rice Cooker. The first batch I made came out perfect: soft, fluffy and flavorful. Once I took that first bite of rice, with pork chops and gravy, I knew I made a wise decision. The meal was perfect, the whole process was easy as pie, and the clean-up afterwards was the cherry on top. If you have ever had to clean the burnt residue out of a pot, after cooking rice in it, then you know the pain in the rear-end that can be!I came upon the Zojirushi Rice Cooker will shopping around online for a rice cooker. There were plenty of options (many of which were cheaper than this one,) but, after reading the reviews, I was given the best impression of this one. Upon owning it now for about 2 years, I do not regret my decision at all. The rice cooker is still going strong and still churning out some top-notch rice.Induction Heating (IH) Technology: You wouldn't think of a rice cooker as being high-tech, but you can throw that assumption out the window with this rice cooker. The special induction heating technology ensures equal distribution of the heat throughout the rice, which ensures consistent, and perfectly-cooked and heated rice. The IH technology is also great because it will keep the rice warm for hours after it is done cooking.Healthy Cooking Options: Another high-tech feature of the Zojirushi NP-HBC 5 1/2 - Cup Rice Cooker is that it has special settings for various types of rice. There is a white rice setting, a brown rice setting, a GABA brown rice setting and even a germinated brown rice setting. I did not know such settings even existed until I read about this rice cooker.Easy Clean-Up: Cooking rice can be a messy affair, but not so with the Zojirushi 5 -Cup cooker. The coating of the pan just makes the rice residue slide off without much resistance at all- even if the rice has been left in the pan for a long time.Pros:1. It is extremely easy to use, and even easier to clean!2. You barely have to do anything: put the rice and water in the cooker, set the setting, and voila! perfect rice in no time!3. The range of settings are fantastic, and will ensure that you will never bore of eating rice.Cons:1. It is a little on the pricey side, but that should not be a worry if you get a bunch of use out of it.All in all, I am not disappointed with my investment. I did wince when I paid the price I did for it (as there are tons of cheaper ones available online,) but, I have no complaints otherwise. There is nothing I love more than a good batch of rice, and this is about as consistent a rice cooker as I could've hoped for.",

Lesser amounts of water are heated in mere seconds.The kettle appears to be of solid construction.  I bought one for my mother about four years ago and she still uses it every day.  The newer colors are a great improvement, making the kettle attractive enough to be left on the counter top. However; it is conveniently sized and light weight enough to be stored for future use.If you want to save money on your electric bill, this is a great investment that will surely pay for itself rather quickly.",

        "Review": "It took me a while to finally decide on this model of Panini grill and was okay with it for the three weeks that it was operative with the exception of some issues. One problem was the top grill popped out quite easily and at one time fell off on my hand while I had the grill open and was placing food on the bottom grill. Talk about a major safety issue! The second issue is that the \"ready light\" indicating that the grill is hot and ready to be used never turned on. Of course, the third and final problem is that the grill actually stopped working after three weeks as I mentioned earlier. I will be returning this immediately and hope that there are no problems and I get my money refunded.",

        "Review": "Initial impression is that it is a solid machine, the mechanism to load K-cups is straightforward and seems to create a solid, flat seal with the K-cup. Brewing speed is slower than my previous Keurig - about 30-45 seconds between each cup where the Keurig was ready in about 10-15 seconds. On the other hand, the water temperature is definitely hotter on the Mr. Coffee brew; I need to cool the drink a bit before sipping whereas the Keurig was drinkable immediately after the brew.  I see the hotter water as an advantage of the Mr. Coffee model.Power saver mode can be enabled (shut off after 2 hours of non-use) or disabled (always on) by pressing and holding the power/brew and cup selector buttons for 5 seconds. The water reservoir seems smaller than it could be. The reservoir allows for 4 10-oz cups which leads me to fill it about 2 times a day in my house. Part of the reservoir space is lost due to the inset created as a handle so that the tank can be more easily lifted and held while filling it.I do miss the feature of a timer - being able to automatically turn on the machine and let it pre-heat in the morning so that I can quickly make a mug of coffee for the road on my way through the kitchen, then shut off 10 minutes later. The brewer turns on automatically when the brew head is lifted to insert a K-cup and the brewer is ready in about 1 minute. Turning the brewer off manually requires holding down the power button for 5 seconds. If you don't wait the full five seconds, a brewing cycle starts (thank goodness for the drip tray!).All-in-all, it is handy and it has the basic functionality of the Keurig models, including the ability to use the &#34;My K-cup&#34; system for your personal loose tea or ground coffee. This machine, like so many small appliances, is made in China... (sigh). The price is good, but personally, I would be willing to pay an extra $20=$30 if it was a quality product with a &#34;Made In The USA&#34; stamp on it.I've cycled through three Keurig machines in the past 3 years; the most recent Keurig developed a pump leak and shorted out the power supply, So, I'm anxious to see how the Mr. Coffee brand with Keurig &#34;technology&#34; holds up in the long run.",

After about 6 months I noticed some cracking of the paint on the edge just inside the door. I called and was told it was \"cosmetic\" and not covered under warranty, but would be perfectly safe. One day I opened the door to find the area where the paint cracked at the edge was now a big chip of paint about to fall off. I contacted the Emerson again.Since this is a long story involving multiple calls in which I was told something different each time, I will tell you the basic gist. I was told I could cut off the cord and send it along with the glass plate (at my expense) along with $15 and they would send me a new microwave. If I had it for 2 yrs, this might have been reasonable. The paint started cracking and chipping off! Initially they said this was \"cosmetic\" but when the chipping started to spread to the inside, it was agreed this could be a safety issue. Instead of replacing what was obviously a defective unit, I was given run around \"this is usually caused by using cleaners that aren't recommended\" or \"not cleaning your microwave often enough\". After telling them my last microwave lasted almost 20 yrs! Not a typo...20. I'm pretty sure I know how to clean a microwave.I was given the customer relations supervisor's contact info. I called and got a vm. I left a total of 3 messages and have NEVER heard back from her! If I see someone at the store looking at this microwave, I show them pictures of mine and let them know about the customer service they can expect. I wish someone had informed me before I wasted $100! So I'm informing you.",

In all these years, the motor has never failed, but the screw cap kit has become loosened.I consulted the manual for my mixer to see that it has part number 4162529 for its screw cap kit. KitchenAid no longer makes this, but they claim that this new part--part number 4163032--replaces it and fits all old mixers. This is NOT the case. It is about 2 millimeters too wide on the diameter, and no matter how many times KitchenAid support told me to try banging it in with a rubber mallet, it just doesn't fit.Do NOT buy this item if you have an old K45 with part 4162529 (mine has writing that says Hobart Mfg.

I like the design so much, I have bought 3 of them. First one eventually burnt out (nothing lasts forever), and I bought a replacement and another as a gift.When they do start to burn out, you will get a melting plasting smell, which others have said. Replace it then before it becomes a hazard to your family. But the real safety issue is that as these kettles age, they start to fail to switch off when the water has boiled. They just keep on boiling. This has happened on all the ones I have owned. Usually, I start the boil before going into the shower in the morning, so that I can make tea/coffee after I come out. But occasionally, when I have returned from the shower, the whole kitchen is filled with steam, and the kettle is boiling away like there's no tomorrow.Bottom line: great design, but these can get temperamental as they age.",

It is longer and wider than my previous Space Maker, and none of the screws included were long enough to install it in my cabinet.  I received no response from their customer service when I asked for help.  I did find screws at a local hardware store that did the job, but it was still a pain to install.  My biggest frustration is the controls.  Why have to turn three knobs to toast?  Older ovens shut off automatically when the door was opened to retrieve toasted food, but this one has to be manually shut off, which seems like a negative in terms of safety.  There is a warning label on the door handle (not shown in pictures) that it can become hot, and the instructions show someone wearing two oven mitts to get their toast out.  The handle also has perforations on the side toward the glass door that have very rough edges.Because this is larger than my last Space Maker Toaster Oven, I am unable to install the can opener I ordered at the same time.  It took me over a month to locate the right screws to install the toaster, and now Amazon says I cannot return the can opener that won't fit in the space I have.

Unfortunately, I am underwhelmed.My chief complaint is that the cooking plate becomes unhinged each and every time I use it, occurring right in the middle of my placing the ingredients inside and/or when closing the lid. When I try to push it back into place, I inevitably touch one of the many hot metal pieces sticking out everywhere and burn my fingers (OUCH!!!!). The cooking plate fits into the hinge with small magnets which are not strong enough to keep it attached. It also comes unhinged every time I open the plate to retrieve my cooked sandwich, which has never magically appeared all in one piece.Next, the egg plate/compartment is not easily sealed, and unless you make certain that the sliding bottom plate is in the absolute perfect position, the egg will leak everywhere. It's not pretty. When you add the top muffin and/or close the lid, it's super easy to shift the plate askew, or cause the entire thing to come unhinged. I'm also not fond of placing my top muffin on top of wet, uncooked egg, which is weird.Lastly, I can't say that I find the finished product to be especially delicious. I'm a vegetarian, so I use spinach and Swiss cheese instead of meat, and I didn't particularly enjoy the sandwiches that I've made with the machine. Sorry, Hamilton-Beach! Better luck next time.",

While using the oven in the bake mode, I started to see smoke rising from out of the vents over the switch area, then I heard a sparking noise from the switch so I unplugged the unit and thought... oh well, another foreign-made crappy appliance bites the dust. So I went on Amazon to shop for a new brand and came upon MANY bad reviews about this model!!  Many people saying that \"it smokes\"... \"it stayed on, even when the switch was shut off\"  so I said to myself, well maybe there's a recall on this thing, or maybe Cuisinart will actually stand behind their faulty switch and provide me with a replacement, WRONG!!!  All I got from Cuisinart was a snotty \"customer service person\" who could have cared less that I and many others had smoke coming from a unit that should not have been at the end of its life span for what I paid for it!  So my advice to you is NOT to purchase this \"electrical hazard\" of a toaster oven and if you have made the unfortunate decision to purchase one and had a smokey switch, call the consumer product safety office and FILE A COMPLAINT!!!  That's my two cents.  PS- we bought a Breville oven and the thing is awesome... so far.",

The base of the glass blending carafe is very wide, so when blending thick smoothies or purees,  the blade ends up spinning rapidly but does not really get things mixed well. I have to stop the blend and use a spoon to get the edges going again.3. Also a BIG problem with the glass blending carafe is that the threads go the same direction as the blades. So when the machine is working hard, like on a smoothie or puree, it actually begins to unscrew from the collar and base. So I have to hold it in place. This seems like a design flaw and is very dangerous is someone isnt paying attention to their machine. When I called Cuisinart about the issue, they said the the only 8 month old machine was out of warranty so they could not replace collar, which they thought might have been stripped. Problem with that explanation is that it has been doing this from the beginning.",

In preparing a large meal with lots of dishes, it's not rare for the the cord to fall into the food.  Certainly, one might touch the cord and then touch the food.As with most safety regulations, it is hard to know how dangerous it really is for the cord to contain lead, but given that I have never seen such a warning tag on any other product, even the $10 Walgreen's blender, it doesn't make sense to take the risk.",

There is no scenario where the toast setting could be more than a 1/4&#34; above the light setting without burning up the item being toasted.  And, all the dial markers are black on black, just slightly raised and difficult to see, so we had to put silver paint on them.  Everything that is cooked, whether toasted or baked, releases a large amount of steam from the door...so much so that it appears that something's on fire and it's quite disconcerting.  It has no timer, which I've always had on all our other toaster ovens.About 3 months ago, the bottom heating element began to split, revealing the ceramic liner under the metal.  Looks like the evil eye on Lord of the Rings.  The unit continued to function (the split got a little bigger) as described above until 2 weeks ago, when the bottom element quit working completely.  As it is under warranty, I contacted Cusinart to see about getting a replacement.  Sure, they're more than happy to send a replacement to me for $10 (I pay), but I have to return the old one, also at my cost.  The cheapest I can return it, because of its size and weight, is $28.  There's no other recourse...they must have the old unit back.  $38 to exchange something under warranty just isn't right.  I've read of similar problems occurring in past reviews...shame, shame.",

The coffeemaker works really well, as does the temperature control.  The problem I have with it is the design of the carafe.The top plastic ring has a lip around the inside of the glass that catches coffee and water when you wash the carafe.  No matter how you clean and shake it, unless you completely wipe out the inside of the carafe, including that little lip, there will be retained coffee and/or water.This design is utterly stupid.  You simply can't completely empty the carafe by inverting.  I think you should be able to wash and rinse the inside and have all the water drain out when you invert it.  Not so with this model.  The trap there catches and retains fluids, making it not only a nuisance, but potentially dangerous because of retention of moisture and bacteria.",

It is a question of fine tuning the power level and cook time through experience.  It is roomy inside with a large turntable.Now to the negative qualities:  I bought this oven on 3/30/12.  Just over a month after that it began not turning on at times.  It has steadily worsened over time.  I am now searching for a replacement.  Guessing there is a short in something.  I am not a drink or snack machine kicker at all but I have gone from slapping it on the side near the Start button to using a light-weight rubber mallet.I am scared to death that it is going to stop completely any day now, berfore I find that replacement.Other minor negatives:  The door is very hard to close and open.  The interior light does not work during cooking so you can't see whether something is going to boil over, etc., or not.  I dislike the timer knob for setting the timer.  It is hard to determine how fast to turn it.  It takes forever or way over-shoots the desired setting.  And it is loud.Would I buy this same microwave oven again?  Absolutely not!  And I am concerned about even buying the brand Panasonic.",

The seal around the clear dual water-level window is LEAKING sporadically and leaves massive puddles on my countertop. It is clearly very unsafe and I am frustrated that this is the SECOND TIME that this has happened with this product. I bought it because I love the appearance and because I trust the Black & Decker brand name.Just today I submitted a complaint to Black & Decker's customer service via email and included the following: \"Please help restore my confidence in your brand!

        "Review": "After going through a new toaster oven every couple of months - none of them lasted longer than a year - we decided to end this ridiculous &quot;buying and throwing away  cheap toaster oven ritual&quot; by getting a topof the line DeLonghi.  It worked just fabulously, and we could not rave enough about it - until this morning after about two months - when DeLonghi suddenly lost some vital parts during breakfast preparation.  That was not a good way to start the day. I called the DeLonghi service line to find out what to do with the diseased member of their family, while staring at my uncooked bacon.  I punched my way through a maze of useless automated telephone response options - finally after half an hour on the line,  I got a rather unfriendly and unresponsive customer service agent who advised me to contact the nearest service center, which is 27 miles from home (one way).  This meant driving 54 miles to bring the thing there and 54 miles to pick it up - or two half day excursions to the Los Angeles area, braving L.A. traffic. After learning that it would take between four and six weeks to fix my DeLonghi  (there must be a lot of DeLonghis giving up the ghost prematurely),  I called Amazon to the rescue.  My concerns were handled professionally and  responsively by a friendly AMAZON customer agent (the DeLonghis could learn from them). AMAZON is sending  a prepaid UPS return label and the DeLonghi goes back where it came from - full refund minus restocking charges - much better than wasting two half days in traffic.  Impressed and reassured by this AMAZON performance,I ordered a new one as our family cannot live without a toaster oven.  However DeLonghi is passe, so we're going with a Cuisinart with a standard 3 year warranty. Thank you AMAZON, you are a great dot-com !",

        "Review": "I have been disappointed by this slow cooker. Since it is an authentic Crock-Pot, I expected a well thought out, high-quality product. Instead, I find that I like this cooker less than any others that I own (I entertain a lot, and slow cookers are invaluable on a buffet table). My chief complaints:1) The outside of this cooker gets EXTREMELY hot to the touch - more than any slow cooker I have ever used. This would be a real hazard if you are using it within the reach of a small child. Also, the vent-hole in the lid releases a significant and steady stream of super-heated air, which could possibly lead to a steam burn.2)Even when I used this cooker on the lowest heat setting, it dried my food out and allowed it to scorch to the bottom of the ceramic insert. I had to continually keep adding water to a pork tenderloin roast to prevent scorching, and that is something I have never had to do before when using a slow cooker. The whole point is to be able to \"fix it and forget it\", but I wasn't able to do that. It required frequent monitoring. A great deal of the moisture seems to be escaping through the lid vent.3) The stirring feature turned my bean soup to bean mush. The softened beans looked like they had been put through a blender. Not very appealing...On the \"up\" side, this is an attractive cooker, and I like having the ability to latch the lid down. But, that isn't enough to make me give this a positive review. I will stick with myHamilton Beach 33259 5-Quart Oval Slow Cooker. It works great and I can confidently leave it unattended.",

Bad move.We usually unplugged the cooker when the rice was cooked, because in 'keep warm' mode, the rice gets burnt or dried in about an hour (like other reviewers have stated).It made good basmati rice with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt - but regular white rice was always burnt at the bottom.The reason for my 1 star rating is because the cooker simply stopped working after about 3 months (used about 3 times a week). It turns on and you can select the rice type, but it simply refuses to heat up.I guess you get what you pay for. We've decided to invest in a good rice cooker that we can use for many years to come -- probably a Zojirushi.",

I removed the bacon, and the smoke was so bad, I had to open all the doors and windows so it wouldn't set the fire alarm off. I was using the temp listed in the manual for bacon. I lowered the temp and the smoke still occurred.One of the reasons I bought this griddle/grill was because it was dishwasher safe as I hate washing dishes. I was very disappointed when I discovered that it was to long to fit in the dishwasher and I had to wash it by hand.It is ok for making some things such as grilled cheese sandwiches, but the overall hassle/annoyance factor isn't worth it. I have used my griddle 2 times now, and I am ready to get rid of it. I can get the same results with a good frying pan and the clean up is a LOT easier.",

Broke cleanly off while I was LIFTING the upper plate away using the top handle, and this was a real dangerous issue. The right half of the top of the griddler fell down onto the burgers I was cooking and flung grease everywhere. Upon later inspection, the hinge was constructed from the cheapest cast aluminum I've ever seen used in an appliance, I'm telling you it is cheaper than pot-metal. With the sturdy over-all construction of the GR-4 Griddler, this left me extremely displeased, as the only cheap materials were used where it mattered most, where there is stress placed on the hinges.

        "Review": "After doing research on the differing models of thermal carafe coffee makers, we decided to take a gamble on the Zoji in spite of the plethora of bad reviews. We really should've trusted our instincts and stayed away.We've had the machine since the middle of October 2011. At first, every thing was grand -- like a new relationship -- all was sparkly and wonderful. Hot and plentiful. Those fools with the negative reviews -- they clearly didn't know how to use this very simple machine! In the glorious beginning, there was never an issue like all of those mentioned in negative reviews. I'd spoken too quickly. The lustre and infatuation wore off quickly enough; after the initial couple of weeks, we had our first leak. That's when I came back to read through all of the reviews to see what we could have possibly done wrong. It was all downhill from there...We have religiously washed the bits and pieces every morning by hand -- no dishwashers. Followed the advice found here in the reviews to fold over the bottoms of the paper filters (which I had always done with our previous coffee makers) and to make sure the top is perfectly aligned. When it started leaking on every other brewing despite our diligent efforts, we then found ourselves altering our normal, everyday coffee rituals just to make sure this blasted coffee maker wouldn't make a mess all over the counter-top. The very bizarre thing being, it leaks from the spout of the carafe itself which then gets coffee all down the front of the carafe and under the lip of handle rim. This adds the extra joy of having coffee drip out from under the handle rim when you're finally pouring yourself a cup of A.M. java frustration. Always fun to clean up extra messes after you've just finished cleaning up your counter-top. To add to the issues with this maker, the lid has been retaining water (or perhaps old coffee) and there's no way to get into the lid as it's factory sealed.I notice a handful of people have no problems with this maker and I have to wonder about the quality control of the units. Some are fine whilst others are clearly shoddy?To recap, here are all of the flaming hoops and changes to our normal coffee-preparing-and-drinking ceremony on top of the recommended babying this machine needs to then still leak and malfunction:What we've done:-- Hand-washed the carafe, the lid and filter basket every day. (The lid retains water/old coffee, which I'd imagine, isn't very sanitary as it's a factory sealed lid.)-- Folded the seams of the paper filters out of the way of the hole in the filter basket and ensured the filter wasn't sticking out above the edge of the basket.-- Used lukewarm water, not cold and not hot.-- Using astrological charts of the planets and stars and scientific measurements, made sure the carafe was perfectly aligned under the drip mechanism.Things we've changed in our daily coffee customs in an attempt to baby this temperamental, ramshackle device:-- Ground the beans for such a short amount of time the brewed coffee now resembles orange-tinted water when poured.-- Ground the beans for such a short amount of time the brewed coffee now tastes like orange-coloured, faintly coffee-flavoured water. We like strong coffee. We can't have strong coffee anymore with the Zoji.-- Put far less grounds in than we would normally do with a non-temperamental, easy-going coffee maker.-- No longer brew our usual 10 cups and have resorted to 8 cups; less water doesn't mean less spillage though.-- Spin around in a circle 5 times whilst chanting \"Be Kind This Morning\" before praying to the Zoji Coffee Gods to not let it leak before hitting the \"On\" button. The Zoji Coffee Gods don't take requests apparently.I would recommend this coffee maker only to the following people:-- Those who enjoy very weak, coffee-flavoured water.-- Those with a strong desire to wipe up coffee spills every morning-- Those with an inside track or a direct line to the Zoji Coffee Gods.To all others interested in a thermal carafe coffee maker, do yourself a favour and save yourself a major headache -- go with another option.",

        "Review": "At first, I thought it was me. But upon closer inspection, the design suffers a great number of fatal flaws.The warning about being burned by steam is inside the lid where you WILL see it while you are being burned by the steam, but not before. It is formed of the same material and there's no visual contrast. It's more stealthy than a ninja in an unlit closet in the dark in a home for the blind.Where the clear body section meets the white top there is a not so visible yet significant gap. Add water to 1/4in of that line and water pours everywhere much like Niagra falls.Add water too close to the front of the brewer and create a magical waterfall on your countertop. There is nothing to prevent pouring water directly down where the pitcher fits. Maybe \"aligns\" is a better word than \"fit\"...If you stupidly think you can pour water into the basket to run an additional batch of tea you'll discover it's a bad choice. Again, flooding of near biblical proportions as the water fabulously pours straight out the front of the brewer.Even if you think you've got the pitcher lined up correctly, the brewer may gravely disagree, flooding your countertop with steaming tea. No really, line it up however perfectly you think you can and it WILL eventually do this to you. And if you've enough hubris to think it'll only happen once, it will prove you wrong.Once you press that jolly neon lit button to initiate the run cycle, you're committed in a way that shames marriage, taxes, and death. It turns on, but it never turns off. Not until it's \"finished\" it's cycle. And by finished it means until every last drop of water poured into the reservoir has been sucked dry.With its fascinating penchant for dispersing water in the most entertaining of ways, it's lack of safety features to prevent these mishaps, poor labeling combined with a really short electrical cord and all that water (ending up where it doesn't belong) and the electrical parts frequently sharing very close quarters - it would not surprise if minor to serious injuries result.Mine is being returned. It's a shame in a way, they had some really good ideas when they designed it.",

The device that lets you remove the carafe while brewing stopped working after I removed the basket to clean it. A few months later, the water pump broke.Since the carafe was still usable, I decided to buy the FTX45-1, it being similar to the old one. (The old carafe would be a spare should this one's break.)After just two weeks of using the pot to brew only water, the pump broke. The same problem the other reviewers have mentioned. The water gets hot, a tiny bit spurts out, and the pot dings that all is done. Even restarting the machine and letting it run for an hour produces no better results.It's bad enough having to buy a new coffee maker every year or so because of poor workmanship.

        "Review": "Purchased this kettle in May 2009 with high hopes.  We are avid French press coffee drinkers and also enjoy a variety of teas.  This kettle seemed perfect for our needs.  We use the kettle on a daily basis, usually heating water 3-4 times per day.  Near the end of the first year I started to notice that the temperature sensor was not shutting off at the desired temperature and would continue on to a FULL rolling boil despite lower temps being selected.  Magically, this would correct itself and then happen again.  Now it is happening more than not, rendering the kettle unreliable for our needs.  I am also concerned that with a malfunctioning thermostat (which is what appears to be the case) this kettle might not shut off at all, leading to a fire hazard.  Overall, while we enjoyed the kettle for it's first year, it is now lived out it's usefulness and considering it is out of warranty, a loss. My silver lining lies in the fact that I purchased it w/ my AMEX card so through their Buyer's Assurance program, my warranty is doubled - so I will recoup my investment in the end.  So buyer-beware, this kettle seems to have a useful life of about 1 to 1.5 years.  Other reviewers have also noted a similar breakdown after this time-frame.  For the price, this kettle is overall a poor value.  I will not be purchasing a replacement from Breville with my AMEX reimbursement and will shop for other options...maybe the new Cuisinart will be of better quality.

I got rid of the teflon (which I do believe to be toxic when heated.)The small pots are still fine, but mostly are used for boiling/steaming vegetables. The little frying pan is still functional, too.We've been very careful to care for the cookware according to directions: never put in dishwasher, season it periodically, plastic utensils, etc.The large frying pans worked great for a year or so, but then began to stick.  More and more oil is required and still food sticks.  As others noted, a residue has collected that is impossible to remove, and this causes food to stick all the more.I'm going to see what Cuisinart will do with the Lifetime warranty, as the large frying pans are no longer usable.  Alas.  I hope they will perfect this technology, because I do prefer to cook in non-stick cookware.",

I frequently suffered minor burns on the griddle when lifting it to remove my waffles as it's incredibly difficult to open it without touching the grill itself.  If your batter is even slightly sticky, it becomes even more dangerous provided you can get it open at all.  Often, the grill itself would come off its two flimsy hinges and present a whole new problem.  On top of it all when it would work, it would take several minutes for a waffle to cook.Compared with the replacement waffler that we just purchased, I have a full understanding of how extraordinarily poor this waffler is and hope that no one has to endure what we did with this product.",

        "Review": "I bought this about a month back and I can't say how pleased I am with it.  The grill was easy to assemble, provides an excellent sear and the \"infrared slats\" do an excellent job of preventing flare-ups from scorching your burger, etc.The only reason I gave this grill 4 stars is the laziness factor--there is none.  Because of the IR grill slats you need to be sure to clean and oil down the slats after each use.  It never takes me more than 5min or so after the grill has been burned off and cooled but unlike my old grill you really can't just skip it and clean it the next time if you want the grill to last and you don't want a major mess to clean later. That sucks if you have company or if you grill later in the evening like I do.Pro's:-Easy to assemble-Great temperature control-excellent sear and no flare-ups-compact and easy to storeCon's:-Must clean after every use-The rear of the grill is always hotter than the front.  This isn't as bad as some people have said--really it takes about 2-3 min longer to cook on the coolest part of the front of the grill than the back, so not really too big a deal.I think people will either love or hate the IR system and I really think the deciding factor is how proactive you are with cleaning.  The bottom line is any grill without the IR system can perform as well as this one as long as the cook knows what he or she is doing and how to deal with flare-ups, etc.  This grill is good for the novice or for someone like me who doesn't mind the clean-up and enjoys not having to keep an eye on the grill constantly while cooking fatty burgers, etc.",

I was so happy to find out they were finally selling this oven again!  The price was kind of steep, so I waited. Finally they dropped it to $99 and I had a $10 coupon.  I snapped it up.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It is great for our needs.  I can see that it might be a little small for folks wanting to cook larger items - but it works great for our purposes.  Makes wonderful baked potatoes, toast, bagels, waffles, fries, chicken nuggets, hash browns, great for roasting hot dogs or sausages, chicken breast, steak - really anything you want to try.  It gets hot fast.  No preheating.  You will have to experiment with the temperature and time settings because it is not the same as a conventional oven or even a regular toaster oven.  One note - the rack does not look like the one in the picture.  It does not have the squiggly bars or the cross pieces, but only straight bars and no cross-pieces, just like the old one.",

The iron cooks the waffle to a burnt crisp on the outside edges, while not cooking it on the inside.  We got the same results no matter how much time we cooked it.  It steams/smokes like crazy.

There is no possibility of making a smoothie or milkshake or 'frozen' drink like you are used to getting at a cafe or bar.  On 120 volts (plugged in to a power converter) it is still weak and ineffective.The round plastic pitcher is also poorly conceived.  The best blenders have squared off pitchers, so that the ice slams against the side over and over and is pulverized.  There are lots of pretty blenders out there with round pitchers, and they are all not as good as even a cheap square pitcher model you can buy for $25 at any department store.Overall the quality is poor - not at all what you would think a company with such a history of blenders would produce.  Like many companies today, they are riding their brand name.Just to qualify myself : I have used most blenders commercially available today, and own 4 blenders.  I make smoothies every day, as well as milkshakes, margaritas, frappes etc. from time to time.

So I gave it a shot and can say that I am very satisfied with the product (and not just because the cornbread actually tasted good). You do have some special care associated with cast iron and you should not put it in a dishwasher, so be resigned to hand washing and wiping it with canola oil after each wash. The handles on the pan make it easier to remove from the oven, which was a concern considering the weight of the pan.",

I had been reading about how good popcorn is for you if it's not swimming in butter and oil or whatever else they put in those microwave popcorn bags. So i bought this after i tried the whole paper bag trick, which didn't work; i just ended up with a bunch of scorched paper bags. Anyways, i was reading about these popcorn popper bowls and decided to buy this one. I tried putting a little bit of popcorn in to try it out. i put like a tablespoon in. I let it pop for like 5 minutes and got barely any popcorn out of it. Reading the reviews i was baffled about how this could not work. I thought maybe it was the popcorn i had bought, since it was just generic Safeway popcorn, no fancy name brand, either way i was totally bummed.I was bored and started reading the cardboard wrapper it came in and realized it said \"1/3 to 1/2 cup\" ohhhh i exclaimed. Maybe i wasn't putting enough in, after all it's a pretty big bowl. So i decided to put 1/3 cup in. At first it popped meekly and then it started going crazy. \"It's WORKING!j\" i shouted (at no one, haha) I can't imagine putting a half cup in, unless you wanted a microwave full of popcorn. Anyways, I just got done popping some delicious and healthy kettle corn in this popper. I didn't use any oil, just sweet-n-low and salt, i think it would be better coated with seasoning if i dumped it out on a tray and sprayed with some Pam, that wouldn't add very many calories and would make the popcorn more delicious.I put the bowl in for like 5 minutes and took it out when the popping slowed down. Out of the 1/3 cup i originally put in only 50 didn't pop, that's including the half popped ones that didn't come out of the shell, i think that's pretty good. I'll probably reuse the unpopped ones when i make the next batch, since as i mentioned earlier a small batch won't pop properly. I guess if you don't want to have to make giant batches at time you might want to look for a smaller bowl or just make a lot and then put it in a big ziploc bag.",

This one lasted less than a year, and this morning I went into the living/kitchen area and smelled a strange odor.  It took me a while to discover it was the coffee pot.  It made coffee and apparently overheated to the point of burning the bottom of the glass carafe.  It was off when I found it, so it appears to have shut off--thank goodness!  I later plugged it in again and the lights came on, but it wouldn't do anything.  This pot has numerous reports of overheating and nearly starting a fire if you sort reviews by date.  It appears the newer models are defective to the point of dangerous and very unreliable.  Buyer beware if you value your home and life.

It worked great for about a year and one month (the warranty is for a year only) before we started having all kinds of problems with it.  First, it started brewing, heating and vibrating really loudly.  Then, the heating cycle began running continuously and would not stop.  The power would go out spontaneously.  It would brew intermittently.  And then finally, one day, water started leaking out of the bottom of it.  I just about had a heart attack when I walked in the kitchen and saw water all over the countertop and floor with my 5 year old standing next to it and the power cord plugged into the wall.

They said it was out of warranty (yes, by a month - bad luck for me, I guess) and the \"authorized\" Breville repair shop in our area said it did not have the parts to repair it.  What kind of authorized repair shop is that??  Well, that was $250 down the drain.  I have also bought the Breville Smart Oven for $250.  Let's hope that makes it to its one year warranty date so Breville can screw me out of $250 again.

        "Review": "I purchased this pot since a friend of mine had one and has been using it for a while.  I purchased this on May 30th and unfortunately wasn't able to use it until now (July 15th).  I saw the reviews so I filled my pot a few days ago and let it sit for an hour and saw no leaks.  Great I thought.  Today I was going to brew my first 5 gallon batch of beer.  I pulled out my burner, added 5 gallons of water to the pot and fired it up.  It's a hot day out so I thought it was just condensation forming about 1.5\" from the bottom because of the cool (70ish) water.  After a closer look I noticed that near the bottom of the pot it was actually dripping.  Then I saw another drip from a different spot.  Then another spot started to drip.  I turned everything off and discovered pitting all around the outside of the bottom of the pot almost like a ring about 1.5\" from the bottom.  It was like a strainer.So in the end, I cannot return this since I missed the return window.  I will try to smear some jb weld on it to see what happens.  Hopefully that will fix the leaking.  If anyone has any other ideas on how to fix this, let me know.  If not, I guess I am just out of $80.  Live and learn?If you purchase this pot, fill it to the top and put it on your burner.  Like I said above, it was fine until I added heat to it.EDIT 07-15-2013 3:57pm: Just called the customer service department.  They asked that I email them a few pictures of the pitting.  I received an email back within an hour stating that they were sending me a new pot via UPS and it would be in the mail today.  AWESOME customer service.  Had to change it to 3 stars just because of that.",

        "Review": "First this grinder does a great job grinding - for drip coffee and French press - especially for the price.I have both Capresso and Cuisinart burr grinders. Capresso is quieter and less messy than Cuisinart, however almost twice the price. Plus, as others have commented, you cannot replace the bottom burr of Capresso. I find the user experience is much more pleasant than Cuisinart however.Capresso is quieter and has this low-pitched growl. Cuisinart is louder and has a high pitched whine. Between the two, I don't mind the Capresso noise but I find Cuisinart noise to be annoying.Unlike Cuisinart's bottom bin (where the ground coffee falls into), Capresso does not have a top lid. When you open the top lid of Cuisinart, you get coffee dust all over the counter and makes a mess. Due to static cling, there's always some coffee dust up top by the lid. Capresso does not have this problem. It does not have a top lid, and there seems to be less static cling in general.  Plus the top lid of Cuisinart is one more thing you have to deal with, as in removing it and putting it back. With Capresso, after you're done grinding, you just slide out the bin and dump the grind into the coffee maker. One-two step, very quick, very easy!Finally, this seems like nitpicking but the top cover of the clear cone bin (where you dump the whole beans) is square in shape with rounded corners on Cuisinart while Capresso's is circular. What this means is that with the square shape, you must line up the corners of the lid. With the circular shape, you just slap it on and there's no lining up.In summary, this is what you'll actually go through when using the grinder:Cuisinart: Open top lid of coffee container, dump whole beans inside. Close lid (match up corners of lid). Slide cup-indicator (which controls how long the grinder will run), press button to start. Then it grinds. When done, slide out bottom bin, tap it on counter to try to get coffee dust to settle to the bottom, carefully remove top lid of the bin, dump ground coffee into coffee maker, then put the top lid of the bin back on, slide bottom bin back into the grinder, then clean coffee dust off the counter. Done.Capresso: Open top lid of coffee container, dump whole beans inside. Close lid (no need to match up corners b/c it's circular). Twist timer dial to desired cup size. This one action begins the grinding and also controls the run time. When done, slide out bottom bin, dump ground coffee into coffee maker, slide bottom bin back into the grinder. Done. I'm not saying you won't get coffee dust at all but it's not messy like Cuisinart.However Cuisinart is about $45-50 while Capresso is $85-90. That is a huge difference. If you're just looking to spend $50 on a grinder, Cuisinart is fine. If you can spend more, get Capresso.Also, neither grinders can produce true fine espresso grind so it's best to set your expectations accordingly.Side note: You can remove the top burr to clean it but make sure you put it back in the correct orientation (right side up) b/c you can put it back up side down. I did it once without realizing it and once you do that, the clear cone plastic bean bin is very difficult to put back in OR if you do get it in and twist it, it's nearly impossible to remove it without breaking it. Googling this issue, it seams like many others have done the same; it's easy to do if not paying attention. Just don't make this mistake.",

        "Review": "I bought this juicer and found it be be satisfactory in juice yield (as long as you aren't comparing it to a masticating juicer like many people have done in reviews I've read), ease of use, ease of cleaning, etc.  There is, however, a reason I chose not to keep this juicer.This juicer has a tendency to overflow while juicing.  So much so that the manufacturer sells an accessory kit that includes an \"overflow platform\" that is meant to sit under the juicer to keep any overflow off your counters.  The overflow problem is one I have not seen with any other juicer, but the biggest problem I have with this juicer is where the overflow goes... right into the vents for the motor!I am a seasoned juicer, so I should not have caused an overflow to begin with, but since I did, let me tell you why an overflow is more than a cleaning headache.  The overflow doesn't flow from the spout, it flows from between the seams of the unit, directly over the machines venting system.  If juice gets into the motor it could become a fire hazard and I doubt that the lifetime warranty on the motor would cover juice in the motor, as it would more likely be called negligence and void the warranty altogether.  Several other juicers are similar to this one with vents on the side, but they don't leak or cause overflow issues.  Other juicers have vents on the bottom of the unit instead of the side.  You don't' have to settle for this machine.  I would not recommend this juicer.",

However, I have now owned two of these since April 2013, and have had the same problem with both.

        "Review": "Concept: ExcellentPerformance: JunkI gave it one star because of one thing. It's a great concept when it works.BUT: Keurig needs to go back to the drawing board or start using quality internals in these brewers. The average lifespan seems to be about a year or less for most reviewers who posted a review after having owned one for some time. It's quite apparent there are common problems that all encounter (and you WILL have problems if you buy one). In fact, I'd like to read a review from someone that has this machine- that gets used regularly (and I mean a couple cups a day), that is older than a year and a half and has had no problems!We'll be on our third unit in a year soon, the first one died just short of one year, and this morning, the second one (about 2 weeks old) died completely as well, after a scary and unexpected self-start-brew that got the machine almost too hot to touch.Our machines are well taken care of, get used for 3 cups of coffee every morning, are not left on all day, and we de-scale them. I don't know what else we could do to maintain it.Our first almost made it to the one year mark. Cos_co cheefuly gave us a brand new one when it malfunctioned and altogether quit. It had it's moments where we'd have to unplug it to get it working again, but we could always 'nudge' it back into brewing us a cup. But it eventually just stopped doing anything.A week later now, the new free replacement one was working fine (although the pump was louder than the old one), when this morning all of a sudden I hear a whooshing noise coming from the kitchen and hear a liquid pouring. I had brewed my first cup about 10 minutes prior and now the machine was making another cup on it's own, with no coffee cup to catch the results! Upon investigation, the unit got very hot to the touch, it back-filled the water reservoir with very hot water, (removing the water resevoir felt like I had just poured boiling water into it), and it got hot enough to melt/distort the plastic k-cup that was still in the machine from my previous cup of coffee. Now it's completely dead as well. I have unplugged it and tried to restart, but short of the display illuminating with 'not ready', it's completely dead. No pump noise, no water-heating-up-gurgling noise, the buttons do nothing, no flashing leds when you remove the water reservoir...it's just another paperweight.I feel like this latest one could have started a fire or who knows what if I had not been there to unplug it after it decided to heat up and brew a cup with nobody around. It got scary hot. Who knows what is going on inside of this thing, or what it was going to do next; it acted like it was posessed. Keurig needs to get their act together. They appear to know the machines will develop problems and seem to expect them to, so they cheefully give you a new one when you complain.The minute they make us buy another one we will move on, although it's closest competitor seems to suffer from some of the same quirky shortcomings. It seems that these machines as a whole from either Cuisinart or Keurig have not been perfected yet in terms of durability. Until they stop giving us a free replacement, or we happen to not have any more previously purchased K-cups left, I'll keep taking their free replacement machines for now or until they go out of business. Hardly a good business model either, to have a product they know is defective and just keep giving away replacements. Make it last a few years first...for the intial purchase price, I would think it would. They aren't cheap enough to become useless paperweights so regularly.Looking back, I have never owned another small (& expensive!) appliance that I've had to baby so much into giving me what I expect from it, only to have it eventually die a quick death. And babying a countertop appliance into giving me a cup of coffee in the monring is not my cup of coffee.",

        "Review": "Well, earlier today I was at a retailer contemplating another Keurig purchase since I am tired of the temperature of the coffee from my Mini Keurig. The Tassimo makes an awesome, hot cup, but I was just afraid to spend another $100+ for another machine, especially since I have a boatload of K-Cups left. I saw this cute little Hamilton Beach for $9, including 18 pods, so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was just aching for a HOT cup of coffee since my microwave broke!I had remembered that Senseo was one of the original single serves, so I figured the technology was pretty good. I put a cup of water in first to clean it out, and put my finger in the path of the water! Ouch! Awesome! I brewed a cup of the Medium Roast, but it was truly like a light roast. Very weak - please note that if you like a strong Starbucks brew, you WILL be disappointed. I'd imagine tea would be awesome through this little machine!I added powdered creamer before brewing, but I'd hold off next time. (I suppose this explains why there was only one package of the Dark Roast left on the shelf.) Not bad at all, considering the price - just your basic brew over without the mess. This would be perfect for a basement, office, or dorm room! I heard another reviewer say the cord isn't long enough, but it is at least 20\" long, and you can tuck some of the length back into the machine. I use a different cup to fill the maker so the tap doen't cool off my mug.Sure, the Mini K has lots of flavor options, but it just doesn't taste that great since the temp isn't right.Re: The Keurig Mini - I had heard other people say that you should run hot water in the mug before brewing, or heat in microwave after brewing, but I think that is pretty insane to have to do with a $100+ brewer! I've heard that the fancier models will adjust the temperature.",

Well, now I have had the exact same problem with this oven TWICE in 18 months.  The first time was after I had had the unit for just under a year.  Loud (BZZZZZT!) and frightening white sparks came shooting off the \"wave guide cover\" (I'm now a expert on microwave malfunction) The kitchen filled with enough smoke to set off the fire alarms.  Sharp covered the repair under warantee but offered nothing to compensate me for the 30 minute trip each way to the repair shop to drop it of, and again to pick it up.  I gave it a chance because we really like the oven.This past week (6/15/10) 6 months after it was repaired, it started sparking and smoking again!  Needless to say I am furious and frustrated.  After some haggling and my absolute insistence that I would never run this thing in my house again, Sharp agreed to send me a new unit of this model for $50 including all shipping etc.  I agreed since we love the way the oven looks and works, (except when it's on FIRE!)  Ironically, both times this thing has failed I had to go up to the attic and drag down our smaller 15 (!) year old microwave that still works perfectly!!!  This is the last time I'm dealing with this problem.  If the new one blows up too, it's going out in the garbage and I will never ever EVER buy another Sharp product.11/6/12 Update:  We are very glad that we went for the $50 replacement unit in June of 2010.  In two years of constant use this microwave has made up for the bad behavior of its predecessor.  It does a great job on many tasks including defrosting meat without cooking it, and it hasn't had any sparking or smoking problems.",

So I walk over to the pile of toaster ovens to see what other choices in the sore and it was suppose to be a big sale and lowest price of the season etc.  My heart is set on this B&D.  I play on it ; take the rack out and pull on the dials.  It seems to be sturdy enough and I like this sleek stainless steel look.  The Logeigi  one was not bad too.  It was boxy and black.  I was about to walk out the store with the B&D but I remember what if I check out the price on the internet and compares to Macy's.  SO I went home and bough it online on Amazon and it came within a week and am happy ever since.  Macy's price was $99.  Amazon is $57 with out tax.  CA has a $9.5% tax at the time.  It is a very efficient way to warm food.  I use my convention oven all the time and this help me save on gas bill.  I like my food crispy and the timer helps me from burning stuff. The reviews on the net helps me decide to go with this one too.  It is a very fast oven.  I like it a lot.",

Desired time being lower than 10 minutes.  I didn't have to do that for my smaller toaster oven. (Before the number 10 on this toaster, you will see 3 little pictured settings of light toast, bagel toast, and dark toast.

If you have one of those old B&D;'s -- don't replace it!!! fix it!!!)Saw B&D; toaster on sale, assumed it was still a great company, and that purchase was a good bet.  MISTAKE!  Was toasting just a month or so later and thank heavens!  I was in the kitchen!!!  it managed to LIGHT MY TOAST ON FIRE (I've been around a while -- and have NEVER seen anything like it.)  Luckily, fire extinguisher, etc... ok.Did some research, saw that there were a couple of reports of this fire problem... but assumed (don't assume!).. B&D; MUST have fixed this issue.  Mine must have just been a lemon...Exchanged for a new one.Two months later -- the heating elements -- one on top, one on bottom -- stopped functioning properly.  The left side heats about twice as hot (both top & bottom) as the right side.Toast is therefore difficult -- can use only one side of the toaster at a time because heating/toasting is so clearly uneven.Can't use the baker/broiler at all...  obviously, with one-half heating more than the other half...I didn't do anything more about it -- for personal reasons, could not take on the whole return/protest thing at that time.Further research underlines that B&D; has gone seriously downhill in its appliance quality... but so has everyone else (except a few very expensive brands/models).So -- Recommended: Find another solution... until some company gets its standards up.But definitely stay away from B&D.;  It can be very dangerous to stick with them.

        "Review": "We had the 13\" skillet and a pot, both the Calphalon One non-stick.  They both began chipping and flaking after about 5 months.  Normally I would think, if someone complained of this happening to them, that they were obviously doing something wrong to the finish.  I can assure you that we take very good care of our cookware.  We never put them in the dishwasher, hand-washed them the same night after cooking with them, never used metal utensils on them, and used very soft sponges to clean them.  Our skillet began flaking so bad that it started to rust last week so we had to stop using it.  Both the pot and skillet began to chip around the time time, and they were used for two very different cooking purposes.  I believe the finish was defective in the products sold a year ago.  We went in to Bed Bath and Beyond last night to see if we could exchange the two pieces for stainless steal.  (They let us, by the way, believing as well that they were defective).  While at the store, we stopped to take a gander at the same pot and skillet - the new ones have a totally new finish on them.  It looks completely different from ours we bought over a year ago.  I think Calphalon knows about this defect and have since tried to make the product better.  So maybe if you purchase a new piece, you'll have better luck.  However, I would strongly recommend stainless or cast iron above a non-stick set any day.  Even though it's Calphalon brand, beware.Also, we bought the Calphalon One grill pan the same day we bought the skillet and pot.  The Grill pan is still in top shape, never flaked at all.  We cleaned it the same way we did the skillet and pot.  And strangely enough, since it's a grill pan for meat, I've used metal tongs on it all the time - not one scratch or chip or flake.  I think it's hit and miss with Calphalon as they seem to always be changing their products.  Even in the store last night we saw a rack of omelet pans, all with minor differences - they were all the same product number and same price, yet some had smaller rivets, some had slightly different handles, etc. (Leading me to believe that they are constantly changing their design - not to say they are making them worse, I believe they are trying to make their products better, but you might get stuck being the \"lab rat\" as they work out the kinks.) I'm just concerned that Calphalon isn't the top-of-the-line brand they used to be.  It makes sense, though.  The more a professional brand becomes accessible to the public at large, the more they skimp on the production.Another reason why I'm wary of Calphalon now is that on their care instructions, it doesn't matter if it's hard-anodized, stainless, non-stick, or whatever - they have almost unreasonable instructions.  You can't soak them, you can't use cooking spray, you can't you can't you can't.  I would think that a top brand like Calphalon would be focusing on ways to make outstanding cookware - pieces that stand the test of time and are actually made to be cooked in and cleaned.  That's just my opinion, but only in a perfect world I guess.I'm giving them one star b/c I really hoped to use these products longer than one year.  Also, it claims to evenly distribute the heat but it never did, even from day one.  For the same price or slightly cheaper, you can get stainless or cast iron so this set is NOT worth the money.",

For my taste the coffee could be hotter or I would rate it excellent.  It is easy to use and matching strengths to preferences is fairly easy.  (Although be sure to match the grind amount with the amount of water you add.  Messed up a couple of times and ended up with basically brown water.  Not the fault of the machine.  I forgot to move the setting to a higher amount.)I did need to clean the \"chute\" on a regular basis but it was pretty easy.  Overall cleanup was pretty straight forward and not an issue.So much for the good news.  The bad news is that this is not a well made unit.  You can read the reviews regarding the fires.  Mine did not catch fire but we did have water all over the counter top with a lot of \"popping and cracking.  Fortunately I was standing there and immediately unplugged the unit and cleaned up the mess. (Often we just hit go and walk away for a bit.)  Our unit lasted about 18 - 24 months which is longer than the 3 months noted by others.  That is still not very long.  The top of the pot was originally assembled backwards (They sent me a new one but eventually, I figured out how to disassemble and reassemble the top.)  I am now back to a 10 year old Black and Decker which requires separate grinding but makes, and keeps, coffee hot.

How nice is that. All you have to do is put the pod in and press one of two buttons.I tried out the frother tonight with 2% milk and got an amazing foam! It was thick and just like my favorite espresso stand.My husband is excited that my coffee addiction will be less expensive with the Keurig Rivo. I just need to figure out which of the pods I like best and I will buy a large box.Please don't go by some of the reviews, alot of the 1 star reviews are from customers complaining about the price, not the machine. I wish people would post their reviews about the actual product itself and not because they are mad at a price. Does the product work as advertised? Yes or No and rate accordingly.",

        "Review": "This is one of the worst toasters I've ever owned. The controls are horrible, the clock is very innacurate and will be off by 15-20 minutes after just 2-3 days.To cook something you have to manual tell the toaster you don't want it to automatically cut off in 30 minutes. Yes, you read that right, it automatically cuts off after 30 minutes unless you push about 5 different settings at the start of each bake telling it Not to Cut itself off after 30 minutes of baking...This toaster has no light to tell you when it s preheated. You have to wait 7 minutes for it to preheat (according to the manual). There is no indicator to tell you it's reached the proper temperature for cooking.The interior space means it takes like10-15 minutes to toast a slice of bread.To top all of this off, i read a few reviews here on amazon before i bought it saying this toaster might catch on fire. i thought, No Way... well sure enough, After only one month of ownership, Mine started smoking like crazy and would have caught in fire if I had not unplugged it and carried it outside too cool down.",

If you like clean, clear, reliable, high value appliances--don't buy Bodum 3000 Electric Santos.

But of course, it comes with a 1 year warranty from the manufacturer.  Which involves filling out the registration, packing it up, taking it to the Post Office, paying for the shipping, enclosing $14 for return shipping........ would be less effort and similar $ to just buy a different one!!!But then i thought...I could probably just buy a replacement cord for a few bucks.Well I could, if Aroma sold them.So I emailed them and asked for a replacement cord at a reasonable price.And if that doesn't happen, then I will chuck it.  And amend this review. To be a bit more scathing. :-))Update: 12 Mar 2012  Well it's been just over a week and no reply from Aroma.

Take a picture because they will never look this nice again unless you enjoy polishing your cookware after you wash it.  These pans show water spots everywhere!  But on to the reason you are thinking of buying them.  The first night I had them I cooked (steamed) broccoli in the 2qt sauch pan.  After 5 minutes of steaming I pulled the lid off and burned the heck out of my fingers!  The pot lids get scorching hot!!!  Thanks for telling me calphalon.  The next morning I decided to make scrambled eggs in the omelet pan.  I carefully reviewed the cooking instructions as I had learned that calphalon is rather tempermental.  After buttering and heating the 10\" omelet pan and letting the eggs reach room temperature I began cooking the eggs.  They proceeded to stick to the pan like epoxy glue!  I've never experienced anything like it.  I had to soak the pan for two days to get it clean.  I called calphalon and they told me that \"yes\" the lid handles get quite hot because the glass conducts heat and it is absorbed by the metal in the handles.  Thanks for the science lesson, my burnt fingers feel much better now.  I asked them about the eggs sticking and they claimed I need to use more butter.  Heart disease anyone?  I used plenty and my old farberware omelet pan that I bought at a discount store had none of these issues!  I have come to believe that calphalon is like a Rolex watch...  pretty to look at but not practical for everyday use.",

        "Review": "I bought this coffee maker after having left it in my shopping cart for over 2 years and watched the price fluctuate up and down.  It finally dropped to a low enough price that I allowed myself to buy it.  I had put it in my cart because a number of my friends had recommended it as a good thermal carafe maker.  Plus, I liked the way it looked, and most of the reviews were/are positive.I have now been using the machine for a little over 4 months, and it has just started malfunctioning.  I'm not sure yet what the exact problem is, but after reading ALL of the reviews on Amazon - both negative and positive - I see now that I am not the only one to have experienced problems with this coffee maker.Here's what's going on:It overflows with just a few scoops of coffee in the basket (I'm using a gold filter).  At first I thought that I was using too much coffee (although I had not changed anything in my preparations from the first few months), but it doesn't seem to matter how much coffee I use.  The maker no longer drains from the basket well, and so the water and grounds back up, overflowing from the top, sides, etc.To be honest, I have had small issues with this maker since I got it, but I convinced myself that the problems were minimal.  I mean ... it looks so cool, right?  But it's too tall, and condensed water seems to leak from the carafe all the time, and there's something black that streaks across my counter every time I drag the maker along the surface (in spite of multiple cleanings of the bottom of the maker).But now this?  I will try cleaning the maker with vinegar and water, but I have never had to do that so early in the life of a coffee machine.  And after reading the other negative reviews, where people describe how they have to \"baby\" this machine by playing with how much they screw/unscrew the top of the carafe so it engages with the spring at the bottom of the basket ...  who wants to do that?!?It's probably not worth it to contact Zojirushi America, especially after reading other people's experiences, and my time to send the item back to Amazon has come and gone.I'm going to eat my loss and just get another coffee maker - one with thousands of reviews and a solid 4+ star rating.",

I had been looking for two month unsure which grill to get so we settled on the Char-Broil 36,000 BTU 3-Burner Gas Grill, 522 Square Inch with Side Burner. Got it home the legs did not fit on the cart, we called the company they said they would send out the correct legs no charge. Then we went to fire it up and the igniter did not work but we lived with that because we had been do a manual light with the old grill for years. We had to heat the grill up to burn off the factory coating, when my husband went to open the lid he also got 2nd degree burns on his hands- we had to use the \"Ove-Glove\" to open and close the lid. When we called the company, they said there was nothing they could except to use a mitt when touching the grill. Finally, we were cooking for the 3rd time and the warming tray above the grill folded down onto itself sliding what I had on the tray onto the grill itself. The last straw was the fact the grill did not cook the food any better than the old grill we have had for well over 20years. I say do not buy this grill. We returned to the store that we had purchased at and for an additional $200 hundred dollars we purchased a Weber, the lesson we learned is to not to rush into a purchase.",

This coffee maker had pretty decent reviews and the thermal carafe which is a must-have for coffee that doesn't taste burnt 15 minutes after brewing. But it was a tremendous failure in terms of performance. We have had it for about 6 months and things started off fairly well. Coffee brewed pretty hot and no leak problems. In the last 2 months, however, the honeymoon (apparently) over, the coffee now leaks in alarming and copious quantities all over the kitchen counter. We've resorted to placing it inside a rimmed cookie sheet to capture the leaks which amount to anywhere between 1/2 to 1 cup every single brew cycle. We've stood there watching it to see where it's coming from...can't figure it out.  Tired of trying. Will never buy Cuisinart again.

Obviously this type of setup requires 100% supervision to control temperature and keep the oil from burning.The heat up and recovery time are good when using both sides and great when using just one.  The fast recovery time makes a big difference in crispiness.The baskets are designed to be able to rest on the sides of the pans, but in practice it is too cumbersome and dangerous.  The thermometers that come with it are small in length and for them to touch the oil you need to have an excessive amount and risk more splash outs.  I use other long thermometers but wish I had one that was just the right size.My first unit arrived with a bad regulator that leaked and actually caught on fire.  King Kooker replaced it right away, but poor quality control on a fryer is very hazardous.I like this fryer, but if you aren't a seasoned fryer and aren't able to stay with it 100% of the time, you should move on.",

It was November 2012, and after 16 years of loyal service, Ingrid was looking dirty and tired. So as much as we loved her, we reckoned it was time to get a new coffeemaker for our two-person office.I specifically waited until the period between Christmas & New Year's, so I would have plenty of time to research Ingrid's replacement. My boss and I are foodies and coffee snobs, so a good-quality coffeemaker was very important to us.  Accordingly, we were willing to spend significantly more than the $9.99 we could've paid at the supermarket for a disposable Cuisinart.I read a ton of reviews, positive and negative, for all price-ranges, makes, and features of various machines.  I was alarmed and annoyed to discover that not a single coffeemaker was manufactured in the United States.  (Bunn was assembled in the US but made with foreign-manufactured parts.  It was more coffee machine than we needed, anyway, as it was \"on\" all the time, needlessly eating electricity. No, thank you.)As of December 28th, 2012, the day of our purchase, this Capresso Coffee Maker was rated at 4 1/2 stars, with kudos for making hot, strong coffee, programmability and auto-shut-off after 2 hours.  The only complaint was that the carafe was somewhat drippy.  Several reviewers stated they had remedied the drippiness by pouring slowly and/or pressing the lid slightly open while they poured. I figured, \"Okay, that sounds manageable. Let's go with this one.\"Well. For starters, the \"drippy carafe\" was much worse than described.  Pouring slowly did not help.  Every time we filled the water chamber, we had to lay down a cloth or paper towel (more waste) to catch the drippage.  \"The Capresso Mildew Patch\" was what we named the little black stripe where the counter meets the edge of the sink.The badly-engineered carafe proved even worse when we tried to pour a cup of hot coffee. Holding the lid open not only failed to prevent the dripping; it resulted in steam burns to the hand.  NOT a viable solution.  And the dripped coffee stained the butcher block counter, which I now have to sand and paint to remove the permanent impression of defectiveness this ergonomics FAIL has left on the counter and my soul.And yet, I have barely scratched the surface of just how much I hate this thing and why.Today this mini-monument to mediocrity refused to work at all.  We loaded the coffee, filled the chamber with water, wiped the drippage off the counter...and...NOTHING.  The clock was working; the little red light lit up, but the water failed to heat at all.Maybe the fatal malfunction had squeaked in, under the one-year mark, so we checked our Amazon order in the hope of retaining some measure of warranty coverage.  But, no.  The piece of junk had conked out 25 days past the one-year mark. Fabulous.Anxious for validation, I went on to read the reviews entered since I had originally ordered the Capresso coffeemaker. One review described dangerous electrical issues, such as the machine going on by itself, while empty. That was the reason why I had passed on buying a high-end Cuisinart before landing on this Capresso schtick dreck.I went on to count 25 new 1-and-2-star reviews, most of which reported that the Capresso had stopped working within one year of receipt.  The overall rating had dropped from 4 1/2 to 3 1/2 stars.  If I had seen reviews like that back in December 2012, I would never have bought it in the first place.Now we were mad. And even worse, we still had not had our morning coffee.My boss and I looked knowingly at each other, the look that says, \"Chinese-manufactured piece of detritus!\" He was ready to give up, to drop-kick this hunk of metal, glass and plastic clear across the globe, where it would make re-entry and crash-land unnoticed, undetectable through the Beijing smog that hovered over that bottomless pit of cheap, prideless labor, where all the American jobs had gone to die.But I do not surrender so easily.  I pulled a step-ladder up to the counter and climbed to the very top.  There, in the second row of cupboards over the sink, hope lived on.  As I opened the door, soft, golden beams of light peaked out and waltzed gracefully on the ceiling. I swear I heard the Blue Danube playing somewhere, off in the distance.  Inside the cupboard was Ingrid, our trusty old coffeemaker, still stained and in need of a good scrub, but waiting faithfully to be recalled into service.I gently pulled Ingrid down from her high storage perch and cradled her to me as we climbed down together.  Once I had safely stowed her on the counter below, we plugged her in, filled her with filtered water, loaded the coffee, pushed the button and waited.  In five seconds we heard that familiar bubbly knocking sound of yore.Ingrid was back in business, and coffee was on the way.EPILOGUE:Since buying cheap Chinese products means paying again and again, for sub-par, poor-performing products every year...and possibly burning your house down...we have decided to pony up the dough to buy a high-end coffeemaker, manufactured in Germany.  It may cost a couple-hundred bucks, but after this ordeal, we reckon that Ingrid and her progeny are priceless.One question continues to vex us, however: If a first-world country like Germany is able to carve out a lucrative market in the small appliance manufacturing industry, why is a similar pursuit is considered \"unpossible!\" in the Good Old USA?  If any of you marketing, engineering and finance types are interested in teaming up with a couple of sales and project-management types, like my boss and me, to bring coffeemaker-making back to America, please feel free to comment below.",

        "Review": "Very rarely do I want to run in and write a review the first time I use a new appliance.  I had to restrain myself to keep from doing so with this blender and, as it is, I've only managed to hold out for a couple of weeks.  This blender rocks!Over the past 30 years, I've managed to pretty much kill a blender every couple of years so it usually isn't a surprise when it happens.  That was not the case with my most recent purchase.  I've been happily using my Magic Bullet for making very basic frozen smoothies but fell off the smoothie wagon about a year and a half ago.  When I was ready to climb back on board, I decided to take that next step and start adding greens to my smoothies.  The Magic Bullet, for all its wonderfulness, was not up to that task so I decided to purchase a super-duper \"commercial\" blender sold on HSN.  I was duly impressed with its ability to flawlessly blend greens as well as make pretty spiffy moles.  Sadly, that super-duper blender began to moan and groan at about 10 months and ceased to do such a spiffy job with the greens.  Time to look for a new blender.  Not surprising, HSN no longer sells that particular blender and the only place to find it is eBay.  Back to the Magic Bullet and experimenting with aBig Boss Multi Blenderthat I purchased for work--it will be joining me in the office shortly--and time for research for a new blender.Reviews are mixed on all of the super-duper \"high-powered\" blenders.  I was debating between a couple of different blenders, which included the ever famous VitaMix, when I found the VitaMix on sale through another vendor.  I actually ordered the VitaMix but when it came up as back-ordered I had to re-think that purchase.  After all my need was immediate and not several months down the road.  For whatever reason, this blender popped up on Amazon's home page as a \"personal\" recommendation.  After reading the reviews and the specs I decided to give it a whirl and I am so glad that I did.As I mentioned in the first paragraph, this blender rocks!  The first time I used it, I didn't have any greens on hand so decided to just make up a simple frozen fruit smoothie complete with coconut water, all of my vitamins and protein powder of choice: about 1 cup coconut water, 1/2 cup or so powdered ingredients, and 2 cups of frozen fruit and ice.  Turned the blender on and pushed the \"Frozen Drink\" button and watched as the entire mix was blended into a smooth, frozen mix in less than 90 seconds.  The ice and frozen berries were blended so fast I am sure that my mouth fell open in shock.  This was more powerful than the blender previously known as the \"super-duper\" blender.  The next evening I started with coconut water and a couple of cups of spinach on \"High.\"  The spinach was liquefied in mere seconds with no need for a spiffy poke-it-down stick.  It takes longer to open all of the vitamin capsules than it does for the blender to mix the entire smoothie.The blender comes with several pre-programed buttons as well as a separate on/off button which is pressed before one of the pre-programmed buttons.  There is also a \"Stop\" button.  When the \"Frozen Drink\" button is pressed, the blender starts out with a quick \"burp\" and then gradually speeds up to high rather than straight to the high speed.",

        "Review": "At first we loved this toaster oven. The size was perfect to cook a meal for family of four and it did decent job on toast, bagels and other quickies. Yes, it gets hot as most toaster ovens do but take the necessary precautions and it's no problem. In fact, I used the top of the oven to keep a plate warm from time to time. At about 14 months, the spring that holds the door from crashing onto your counter broke. I figured it would be a simple part to replace and I'm more than capable to do it, but I cannot buy this part anywhere so I gave up on that. So every once and a while the door would slip out of one's hand and crash on the counter. No big deal.  Now, just after 2 years, the unit has become possessed. As many others have reported, it will turn on all by itself and run your last setting. Not good if you put something in the oven and didn't know the unit turned on until you smelled something burning. And it doesn't just do it once, it will continually run the last setting over and over until you unplug it. Not good, not safe. It probably just needs the electronic control panel replaced but I cannot find parts for it. I'm hoping Back & Decker will read these reviews and take some action to make things right with those having this issue. Not only is it dangerous for the households that are using this oven, this is a big financial risk to B&D if someone were to get hurt or killed in a fire caused by this defect.",

He set it up and I noticed Its major flaws right away.First of all, the door push-open button on our unit started the cooking function of the microwave, even with no cook time or any other buttons having been selected.  We were able to repeat this because we could hardly believe it.  This is dangerous!  We do not want a microwave starting to cook as it is being opened!Secondly, the open button itself was quite difficult to depress, and pushed the microwave back against the wall each time we attempted to open it.Lastly, we noticed that the sticker in the view window had bubbles in it.

I carefully followed instructions and was pretty excited when the time came for me to flick the switch ON (yes anticipation had built up after having to freeze the bowl and the ice cream mixture).Alas, after 15 seconds of churning, it stopped (there was also a funny 'burnt' smell coming from the motor section).  I understand its motor has a safety feature that causes it to stop when it is overworked. So I waited until it could function properly.  After about 6 min, I turned it on, and it started churning for another 10 seconds, then again it stopped.  This happened a couple more times.  Frustrated, and also because my ice cream mix was starting to get runny from the waiting time, I gave up and just mixed with my old food processor, with its mighty powerful motor.Meanwhile, to test this unit, I switched it on while the bowl was empty to see how it will run without any load.  After several tries, and to much disappointment, it only churned an average of 30 seconds before it went dead again. I found I could make better ice cream by putting the mixture in their frozen bowl, and churning it by hand.  But for me, it's back to my reliable food processor.Kudos to Amazon for their amazing customer service.  They responded and acted quickly on my complaint and offered a full refund.  Now, I was thinking of still acquiring another one of this unit (thinking maybe mine was just defective), but after reading the 1 and 2 star reviews, I think it would be wise not to.",

        "Review": "I bought the DCC-1200 for one basic reason.  My wife wanted one that was easier to clean than the Mr Coffee we had and that would not show coffee stains as easily as the white Mr Coffee.The Cuisinart is easier to clean and the black plastic hides any errant drips or splashes. The machine looks large, imposing and impressive.In a blind taste test between the old, inexpensive Mr Coffee and the new Cuisinart, I could not tell the difference.The various options and controls are interesting, but once set I do not use them. There is a beep, beep, beep when it is done brewing and a beep, beep when it shuts off [after a user defined interval]. I usually have my first cup when it begins the \"almost done\" gurgling which I find more useful than beep, beep, beep. The last beep, beep is useful as I know the coffee is too old to drink, but one more cup may be all that I need. Or it tells me to make another pot and start the beep, beep, beeping all over again. Do you find the beep, beep, beep annoying as yet?There are things that I do not like. The carafe must be made by the same people who make the dribble glass. It is next to impossible to pour without dripping. All the carafes we have ever had were the flip up cover variety where a one handed thumb motion is all that was needed for convenient  filling. This carafe has a lid that snaps on and must be removed to fill. A two handed operation. Snapping it back in place requires minor precision and the feeling that it is not going to last.Once you have it filled, pouring the water into the coffee maker is a small challenge  as you have to hit a small opening at the top rear and it dribbles on the counter as you fill. There is no external indication of how much water is in the reservoir and a little set of stairs internal to the machine leaves me clueless.The filters are the Melita type for which you can find the cheap version.So all in all, it is not great and it is not awful, it is just OK. And it makes coffee which is all I wanted int he first place.So I am happy.UPDATE: The first one finally died and after searching for a replacement, I bought the same one again. You would think I would learn, but I could not find any reasonable substitute at a reasonable price.This one does not have the dribble carafe and appears to work much better. As a result, I upped the rating a bit.",

This is hard to see and use effectively so we used the carafe to measure instead.  The sneak-a-cup feature does not work well and an ounce or so of coffee leaks onto the hot plate.  The hole in the lid is quite small and if the coffee pot is not aligned perfectly, water spills past the pot making a mess.  As for other comments about being loud, the unit is a bit louder when brewing but not a big issue.",

        "Review": "I've been using cheapie rice cookers for a while with good results. I decided that it was time to step up to a &#34;real&#34; rice cooker. This review compares the Panasonic to a fifteen-dollar Rival cooker from Wally World. I'm glad that I kept the Rival. For brown rice, it's a much better cooker.Panasonic pros versus the cheapie cooker:* White and brown rice are both consistently excellent (the cheapie cooker sometimes overcooks the rice a smidge).* Can do fancy things like &#34;bake&#34; a cake.* Has a built-in clock and delay function.* Steam valve never overflows.Panasonic cons versus the cheapie cooker:* Slower on white rice, even in &#34;quick cook&#34; mode; takes 2 hours for brown rice! The cheapie cooker does brown rice in about 20 minutes, and it's just as good as the Panasonic makes it. The long cooking time for brown rice is common to the Zoji's too, and apparently has to do with pre-soaking the rice in the cooker, which is a nice touch, but you can't override it. &#34;Quick cook&#34; mode works for brown rice too (though the manual doesn't make this clear), but still takes about 10 minutes longer than the cheapie cooker.* More complicated to use. You need to select the type of rice you're cooking from the menu, then press the start button. With the cheapie cooker, you just switch the paddle from &#34;warm&#34; to &#34;cook&#34;.* A hassle to clean. With the cheapie cooker, you throw the bowl, spoon, and lid in the dishwasher, and you're done. With the Panasonic, you're not supposed to put any parts in the dishwasher (I put the bowl, spoon, and lid center/vent part in there anyway--no harm done so far). The main part of the lid is hinged to the cooker, and has a large plastic &#34;seal&#34; part that gets dirty but can't easily be detached. You're just supposed to wipe this part off to &#34;clean&#34; it. Yuck.* Bulky for the size of the rice bowl. The whole &#34;front&#34; control panel section sticks out a few inches. There is a carrying handle that adds a bit to the width and depth of the cooker.* User's manual is overly complicated and buries important info in the middle. Panasonic should take the cooking amounts / times table from the middle of the manual and put it on the front or back cover.Overall, would I buy the Panasonic again? Maybe. Probably not. It costs a lot more money than a cheapie cooker--over 5 times as much. If it did a significantly better job of cooking rice, I'd say that it would be worth the extra money anyway, but it doesn't. It does a slightly better job, more consistently, but more slowly. My recommendation to first-time buyers: Buy a cheapie cooker, and see if you like it.",

If you look closely at the rim of any of the pans/pots you will see the seam.  I have used very sturdy pieces that do cost much more but that extra expense gets you a thicker, one piece, very solid pot.  I was able to flex the large frying pan with my hands.  (Not enough to permanently bend or break it, but it will give a little).  I do agree with most everyone else that these are decent pieces for the price but don't come away with the impression you are getting top notch stuff for the low price.

        "Review": "After reading all the other reviews on this grill, I'm convinced that people were only qualifying their grill based on the fact that it could produce a flame. I haven't even gotten that far yet, and I'm already to the point where I want to return this thing.Upon unpacking this monster, I discovered that there was a fair amount of assembly required. I'm not building an Ikea table, nor am I building a brick BBQ to cement into my backyard, so why all the parts to assemble? That aside, for $250 I should have expected a fair amount of labor involved. I quickly discovered that the manufacturers had shorted me a few of the small pieces (washers and screws) so I made due with what I had handy to finish the job. The wheels aren't sturdy (feel cheap) and they mount crooked as the brackets that were welded onto the bottom for the casters to screw into were welded on askew. I didn't think much of it at first, but I now realize that the wheels scrape against the bottom when I try moving it around. Oh well. Limited mobility. I'll work around it as I don't see myself moving it that often. The frame is cheap aluminum. It bends easily and wobbles around a lot, especially with that heavy iron grill portion on top. The small door doesn't fit correctly. The instructions say to adjust the screws on the door hinge in order to be able to adjust the fit of the door in its frame, but the holes leave no room for wiggle as they are tight fits drilled into metal. Am I supposed to re-drill the holes? The cheap plastic knobs that were sent to control the fuel regulation don't fit properly. I tried to hammer them onto the metal pegs, but they just won't go on as they're not a proper fit. All of the screws and components for the grill have been painted black. It really worries me that all of these paint shavings are going to be in my grill. I just hope they're resistant enough to the heat where no toxins leach into anything I cook (I guess I should just hope that the paint they chose isn't toxic). After 2 hours (the instructions quote 45 minutes) the grill is mostly complete except for the fuel.The nicest thing about this grill is that it came with its own cover to protect it from weather and the elements. It's also a nice size for how little room it takes up (but keep in mind that you'll need a heck of a lot of room to assemble it which doesn't make sense to me). Additionally, if you're looking to have a grill with ledges on the sides (as this one appears to in the picture) then don't bother with this one. The two shelves you see on this BBQ's sides are actually just heavy, metal trays with no hinges. You're supposed to lift it and pull out a certain way to make it stick. It's actually just trying to squeeze that one small edge against the frame to make it stick out horizontally. It's difficult to explain, but I don't know why they didn't just give it a hinge. The pressure technique (don't know what else to call it besides chintzy) doesn't hold up. The tray just slams down (with a loud bang!) to a vertical position again against its own weight. It already dented the sides of my grill like that, and that means it won't support any weight either so they're basically just for show (when kept vertical).I attempted to contact customer service via phone multiple times already, but haven't been able to get through to anyone. I tried leaving a message in their voicemail box...but it was full. I thought I got through to someone a couple times...but it turns out I had just been disconnected. Doesn't seem like they have any customer support for this thing. If I can't get anyone to send me the extra pieces they forgot to send me originally, another couple of knobs to see if they fit, and maybe some support for the issues I've been having with the side trays, then I may just end up returning this behemoth via mail! What a waste of time and energy! I would have preferred to pay an extra hundred for a similar model (preferably a working one) at a store and had them deliver it already assembled!As soon as I'm able to grill something on this thing I'll update my review. If I don't update my review, it means the thing just didn't work. I won't be able to try to grill anything, however, until I get some clarification from the manufacturer regarding their instructions for step 10 that references a different section in the instructions on \"engagement\" that doesn't seem to exist, but if I don't perform this step then operating the grill could result in \"fire or explosion, possibly causing serious injury or death.\" Well, if you want me to be able to perform this step then you should probably include it in the manual!2014-01-04 - Update: I have the grill up and running, and have grilled a couple of times. The grill works great! I'm able to reach temperatures of 600 degrees fairly easily as well. Was a pain to set up as I have never put together a barbecue before. Did the leak test and didn't see any issues, so that went smoothly. The grill grating is a little hard to work with. Almost lost a burger patty or two between the grating. Additionally, the grates are very heavy and seem to hook in at the sides. Honestly, if you lose something halfway down between the grill, you're going to have to work to save it.Was finally contacted today via email by support, and they're going to send me the parts they neglected to ship.Overall, since the grill works great (except for the shelves which I've had to shove something in between the body of the grill and the shelves to give it a tighter fit and some grip so the shelves don't slam down to vertical), and there were no hiccups with any of the vital parts, I'm changing this review to 4-stars.",

There is also a problem with the handle breaking and it does leak ( I would put up with the leak if the thing would just work otherwise)",

        "Review": "We formerly owned a George Foreman grill (model unknown) for many years. Finally its non-stick surface on the plates wore out and, though the grill was still functioning perfectly, to replace those plates would have cost almost as much as buying a new one.So we bought aGeorge Foreman GRP4 Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, Whitefrom Amazon on January 12, 2012. We have been using this unit, which is fully satisfactory, until two days ago when we got this newGeorge Foreman GRP2841R 5-Serving Removable Plate Grill with Variable Temperature.I have to tell you - this is BY FAR the best George Foreman grill we have ever owned. Even if its styling is a bit strange (it reminds me of the top of \"David Bowman's\" [Keir Dullea's] space helmet from the film \"2001\"), who cares?It cooks well and FAST, much faster than either of our older ones. Using nearly the highest heat setting, my wife cooked four (4) large (though not the thickest) frozen (only partially thawed) hamburger patties to fully-well-done (that's how we like them) in a bit less than twelve (12) minutes! She clocked it. Amazing! She did not pre-heat for the recommended eight minutes; she pre-heated only for about two minutes.And the taste? Practically as good as hamburgers cooked over a charcoal grill outdoors.The drip tray was even greatly improved over the ones on our previous models; it slides and fits in exactly under the unit so that the grease will fall right into it. There's no chance of misalignment.But our burgers seared and cooked so fast that there was hardly any grease at all. This, I am sure, contributed to the exceptional taste.While you'll want to try various heat settings (and they will vary according to what you're cooking), we recommend that, for burgers and the like, you use the highest or near-highest heat setting. I think that will satisfy many people.The plates, top and bottom, remove easily for cleaning and they can be reattached just as easily. The design is near-perfect; maintenance couldn't be more convenient. The two plates and the drip tray can all be washed in a dishwasher. (These items can all be purchased and replaced by the user - but watch out for the prices. These replacement parts do not appear to be offered by Amazon at this time.)Obviously we are keeping our older GRP4 grill as it is still in excellent condition.But we shall now be using this new one - it is so much better.I think the smartest thing George Foreman ever did was to license the use of his name to the company that produces these - and that company has done George Foreman proud. In our opinion the name \"George Foreman\" equates to \"top-quality.\"It's too bad that Amazon doesn't allow awarding more than five stars. I'd award it 100 stars if I could! My wife and I give this new George Foreman grill our highest possible recommendation.Thank you for reading this review and for considering my opinions.Lawrence H. Bulk",

        "Review": "I bought this reconditioned toaster and was very pleased to receive it in like-new condition.  I have purchased other reconditioned items from Kitchenaid and found small scratches or such that were no big deal at all, but the toaster looked like mint.  Of course, its (very attractive) looks would be worth nothing if it didn't toast well... so luckily, I'm happy to report that it does!  I make toast for breakfast every. single. day.  I was using a cheap toaster oven until now that did fairly well, but the toast wasn't adequately crisp on both sides, and would get soggy when I spread butter on.  I had been reluctant to switch to a slot-style toaster (as opposed to a toaster oven) because, usually, when I'd used slot-styles at other people's homes, the bread would toast unevenly.  The edges would be close to burnt while the center was barely browned.  And there was always the question of what # to set a toaster to, and most don't allow you to easily raise the toast to look at it mid-cycle.  This does, and you can take the toast out whenever you see that it's done.  After a time or two of using it, you'll figure out what # you need and it will perform consistently thereafter.Quite simply, this toaster does exactly what it is supposed to do, properly, every single time, is lovely and stylish to look at, *easy* to clean (I love the pull-out stainless crumb tray), and feels like it is definitely built to last.  Expensive? Perhaps.  But if you use a toaster as often as I do, you'll think it's worth every single penny.  Kitchenaid does occasionally offer these for $69.99, though (which is what I paid for mine), so it isn't impossible to find these at an even better price than what's currently listed ($99).",

        "Review": "PROS:+ Classy stainless steel finish for any kitchen d&eacute;cor.+ Five easy-to-set programmable temps built in (175F, 185F, 195F, 200F, 212F).+ Warmer keeps water temp for up to 30 minutes.+ Beeps five quick times when water is ready.  While not what I'd call 'loud,' I can hear this easily from an adjacent room but not from the other end of the house.+ Boil-dry protection.  A must have.+ Buttons on the handle (not the base).  Great placement, easy thumb use.+ Cordless, sits on a sturdy corded base.+ Generous cord length to the base.  When completely unwound from inside the base, by my measurement, the cord length is 32-inches from wall plug to base.  Can be wound up to shorten, as required.NEUTRAL:* Color-coded 'water heat' indicator.  Green, aqua, blue, purple, red give you a rough at-a-glance indication of the water temp (or how close it is to boiling).  Nice feature but doesn't seem to really have a function except that it goes off when your water is boiled, or when the kettle is off.* Auto shut-off.  Nice to have for sure, but...  as soon as you put the kettle on the base, the power comes on.  It does this even when you're just returning it to the base after pouring out your boiled water.  After five minutes on non-use, it shuts off the kettle again.CONS:- Programmable temps are only 175F, 185F, 195F, 200F, 212F.  You can't set it to your own temp, only one of these.  This not an issue for me, but it may be for some users thinking they can program to a specific temp.- Lid sometimes pops open while boiling.  This is probably me not closing it correctly, but it does happen occasionally even when I am sure I closed it securely.- Fill opening is kind of small.  There's not a real lot of space once the lid is open to fill the kettle, but it's certainly not a deal breaker.CONCLUSION:I've been using this kettle daily (four times per day) for a few weeks now and I could not be happier.  It is simple to set the temp and use, and provided you don't unplug the base from the wall outlet, it will remember your settings.  The color-coded water 'heat' indicator is more of a novelty for me, but some may find it useful as a visual indication of the water temp from across the room.  This is one of the best kettles I have used.  I'm hoping that being of the Frigidaire Professional series that it will have good longevity with daily use.  Time will tell on that count.

I've used the blender part a few times to make frozen beverages with liquid and ice, and so far that has worked fine. What I don't like is how cheaply and flimsy the food processor is made. After the first time using it, I found small fragments of plastic in my food, and these had broken off of the interior part of the processor bowl. The central shaft which contains the chopping blades is almost impossible to remove from the bowl if it get the least bit moist. It's like it has been super glued to the motor shaft. Also, I noticed after about four or five uses that something is causing small threads of white plastic to shear off from the central shaft and drop into the food being chopped. When using the grating or slicing blade, the food is not completely processed, and the remaining chunks get caught between the lid and the grater. Overall I could not recommend this or any other Cuisinart&#8482; &#34;appliance&#34; because of all the negativity created by having this piece of junk in my house.",

It's now at the point that it would take most of the morning to pour a cup of coffee from the trickle it now gives and we have resorted to just opening the top and pouring the coffee out of the inside bucket which is A.) Messy and B.) Dangerous since someone could easily get burned.

I have been using the Michael Graves (Hamilton Beach) programmable coffee maker for about two weeks. It made a decent pot of coffee, but the flavor seemed watered down. Even when using the \"flavor\" button.When the Presto arrived yesterday I did a side by side comparison with my Michael Graves coffee maker. I put 8 cups of water in each coffee maker, timed how long it took to \"brew\" those 8 cups, measured the water temp at the end of the brew cycle, measured the water temp after 5 minutes, then measured the water temp after 10 minutes. Here are the results:Michael Graves:8 cups of waterBrew time: 7 minutesWater temp: 170 degreesWater temp after 5 minutes with the hot plate On: 165 degreesWater temp after 10 minutes with the hot plate On: 160 degreesPresto model 02811:8 cups of waterBrew time: 9 minutes and 21 secondsWater temp: 175 degreesWater temp after 5 minutes with the pot still plugged in: 175 degreesWater temp after 10 minutes with the pot still plugged in: 175 degreesThe Presto model took longer to brew, but the flavor was so much better. The sounds, and smells, coming from the Presto model reminded me of when I was growing up and the percolator models were pretty much all anybody really had. It was great stepping out of the shower this morning and being able to actually smell the coffee (no pun intended).The Presto isn't programmable. But, it's easy to get it ready the night before, just like I would in the programmable style, then simply plug in the Presto before I step into the shower. Then I unplug it, pour the coffee into my thermos, and off to work I go.I used the same coffee filters that I used with the drip coffee maker. I just poked a hole in the center so it would slide down over the percolator tube. And, I don't use electricity (however small the amount) keeping a digital clock/timer active.As a result of my unscientific experiment I will be using the Presto model as my daily coffee maker. The Michael Graves coffee maker will go back into the box, and be placed on a shelf in the garage, to be used when/if my Presto finally stops working. It's nice to have a backup in order to avoid those early morning coffee disasters.",

It is sturdy and well made and the inner basket features smooth and safe mechinism to lower it and remove it from the hot fat. They advertise the \"viewing window\" as a feature but to be honest there is no way your going to see anything through it when its cooking as it will be steemed up and there is no light inside!My one big concern about this though is the power-cable. Again it is sold as a special feature. To protect it from ever tipping over it has a power cable that attaches by magnets so that if it ever gets caught on anything it will break off and not tip boiling hot fat over your kids. This is a nice idea, however it really is literally just held on by magnets. And I mean \"just\" held on - they are not the strongest magnets so if you move the fryer at all during operation (fair enough it says you shouldnt -but hey sometimes you got to) the power cable sometimes comes off and you dont notice. My other concern abou this is when it comes off the connections on the cable are just right there, and as you are most likely using this in a kitchen where there could be liquids this is quite dangerous. So yes if your kids are messing with it they wont get scolded with boiling hot fat becuase the unit wont tip over but unfortunatley they may get electrocuted!!",

        "Review": "Regretably, I ignored the mostly negative reviews that I read here and elsewhere and decided to purchase this product from Amazon.  As an Amazon Prime member, I was happy to get the coffeemaker in just 2 days so I could start my long Christmas vacation with a freshly ground, rich and bold cup of coffee (that i roast myself).  As others have suggested, the instructions are pretty much useless.  It's my guess that the instructions were translated from the original German to Chinese, then to Sanskrit before ultimately being rendered in English.Despite the poor instructions, I was able to get the brewer up and running pretty quickly.  I filled the grinder with beans, added water using the fairly nice mug that was supplied, pressed the \"auto\" button and heard the pleasing rumble of the coffee being ground.  After a couple of minutes, I had a very nice, though fairly weak cup of brew.  I cranked up the boldness setting on the left side and tried again, but it didn't seem to make much difference.  I speculated that the grind may be off a bit, but since there are no settings on the other adjustable knob, i couldn't really tell.These minor shortcomings notwithstanding, i was actually quite happy with my purchase.  On day two, however, the gremlins came out.  That morning, I happily filled the water chamber and again hit the appropriate button.  The grinder started and then began to make a sickening, high pitched whirr...the grinder was stuck.  Clearing the jam was not easy and created a huge mess.  After cleaning it, the grinder started fine, but jammed again within seconds.  I tried a different blend (my Ethiopian beans were a bit small), but ended up with the same result...a jammed grinder.  I fiddled with it while my wife scowled at me for wasting money on yet another coffee pot, but each time, the darn thing jammed.I whipped out my handy krups burr grinder and proceeded to grind some beans so i could at least have a cup of coffee.  I filled the filter and started to brew...within seconds, i noticed a nice puddle of light brown liquid puddling around the base...my nice new brewer seemed to have sprung some sort of leak.  I cleaned everything up..refilled the resevoir and tried again, this time watching more closely.  I immediately noticed that the brewed coffee was leaking at the base of the filter.  I fiddled with it a bit more and discovered that a small rubber gasket that is part of the brew pause function was dislodged in the mechanism.  I repositioned the washer and it brewed fine...til the next cup.  It seemed that everytime i inserted the mug, it dislodged the gasket.  I finally removed the gasket completely to resolve the overflow issue, but of course created an annoying drip when the cup was removed.Ultimately, I grew frustrated with the whole experience and neatly packed everything back in the original packaging, printed the convenient return label from Amazon and bid farewell to this conceptually nice, but fatally flawed device.I am very happy that Amazon accepted the return and refunded my purchase.  I am still on the look out for the perfect, single serve with grinder brewer...hopefully someday i will find it.  Meanwhile, my trusty Krups grinder paired with the simple, but effective Aeropress have been forced back into action.",

I'm now afraid the roller wheels will continue to strip the track of the white finish making this little bugger an even bigger fire hazard then it is now..?And as a side bar; the start button has become stiff and indented requiring that I reset and fiddle to free it.

        "Review": "Before I bought my Ronco rotisserie (an upgraded version) I wish I had asked myself (and had good answers for) those two questions. Prospective buyers would do well to give some thought to them before buying. And BTW, you can purchase a better version of the equivalent of their \"injection kit\" from Amazon or any well-stocked local kitchen or restaurant supply store.Retail price for any of the Ronco products is exorbitant, IMHO. For not much more than what the folks at Ronco propose as retail price, you can purchase a new stove! That said--and having answered those two key questions--you are ready to evaluate whether this is a good use of your money, your counter/storage space, and the time you will spend in cleaning it.ON THE PLUS SIDE:*  This does a truly great job of making rotisserie chicken! (But if you already have a stove, a vertical roaster stores in a lot less space, costs a lot less, and cleans up far more easily.)*  The basket and kebob accessories (not included with this particular model) extend its usefulness.ON THE MINUS SIDE:* There is absolutely NO heat shielding--which has two consequences to consider.*  First, if you expect to be using this indoors in warm weather, be forewarned that your indoors will become a LOT warmer when this thing is cooking. There is a single heat setting, which translates to medium high heat; the result is equivalent to turning on a 1250 watt radiant space heater. (It will also tie up an entire electrical circuit, a real consideration if your wiring is more than 10 to 15 years old, when fewer circuits were routed to the kitchen.)*  Second, you cannot safely use this on a counter if the counter has kitchen cabinets above. The bottom of the cabinet will get too hot for safety very quickly. Depending on the cabinet's materials and construction, this may result in buckling, blistering or even fire.*  Despite the famed phrase-- \"set it and forget it\"--repeated periodically on cue by the audience during their infomercial, this appliance cannot be set and forgotten, as the directions clearly state. Personally, I would not leave the kitchen with this appliance on--not even for a VERY short time--if my young child/grandchild/dog would be unattended in my absence.*  Loading/unloading food is clumsy, in my experience--and you had better not misplace the small plastic stand on which the rotisserie rests, or you will be hard pressed to load and/or unload!*  You will need a place to store the gloves, which admittedly do help in unloading.*  Cleanup of the rotisserie is no fun, even for the high end version with reflector shield. (The gloves are a pain to clean, too.)  Without the shield, I can only imagine; what fun--and clean it, you must; the spattered grease makes a \"roach buffet\" that will attract any roach whose antennae are on the lookout for food.BEST FIT: If you plan to eat a LOT of rotisserie chicken, AND have a covered patio/lanai/porch with a convenient electrical outlet, AND room for a sturdy small table--NOT plastic!--on which to use this appliance, AND a place to store it between uses, then purchasing this may work out well. (This is especially likely to be true if you and the other adults in the household agree about who will be responsible for cleanup--preferably the same day.)WORST FIT: If you plan to use this exclusively indoors, have limited kitchen counter space, have multiple small children underfoot,  live in a condo with no balcony or electrical outlet or are charging this on a credit card that you don't pay off in full each month, think twice and then think again.SUMMARY: This is an impulse purchase you can live very well without.",

        "Review": "I have had the WE100PC which is supposedly the same thing...it looks the same too.I've had it for 7+ years and it works okay for me, no major complaints besides the difficult to install/remove pulp container and the broken part. It does sometimes leave larger chunks of food in the pulp container. I don't find it excessively wet as some have stated. Perhaps they're forcing too much food in at once. If not for the broken part, I'd rate it a 4.For those who end up with a broken tab on the bottom of the pulp container like I did, I have a simple fix. The tab I speak of is the white plastic thing on the bottom of the pulp container that hits the safety switch on the base when you put it on properly. I wouldn't waste time or money on buying a new part that will likely fail again. If this part breaks, the machine won't work due to that safety switch not getting switched on to complete the circuit. You can test it by having it plugged in and pushing in this switch with something small enough to fit, don't get shocked (I didn't). If your regular switch is on, the motor will run when you push on this and cut out if you stop pushing it. Careful of the spinning part.The fix?Be like Tim-the-tool-man-Taylor and rewire it.Unplug it of course so you don't get shocked.Flip the unit upside-down. You'll see 4 phillips-head screws on the bottom. You can't miss them. Not the 5 that hold the rubber feet down around the outside perimeter of the unit. Unscrew these 4 screws and pull up on the metal base and it will come right off.You unplugged it, right?If you look in the center, you'll see the motor and electrical stuff. Avoid that area. Look more toward the outside and farther down (right where the tiny safety switch from the outside of the unit was located). You'll see the clear plastic part with two wires connected to it (black and blue in my case) and two phillips-head screws holding it down. This is the safety switch that the plastic tab thing on the pulp container is supposed to hit. Take out the two screws and pull the clear plastic switch up. Cut off the switch part from the wires as close as possible to where the wires and switch meet so you have long wires to work with. Strip the wire ends of the blue and black wires that used to be on that switch and connect them together. I used solder and some heat shrink tubing b/c it was handy from my recent stereo install. You can use a wire nut, butt connector, or be ghetto and just twist the wires together tightly and cover with electrical tape to insulate it so it doesn't short at some point. Tuck the wires neatly out of the way, where they won't get pinched by the base reinstallation, etc.Then, as Mr. Haynes says, installation is the reverse of removal.I would assume you're going to be careful with installing the pulp container/blade assembly from this point forward since the motor will start whenever you hit the main switch. This would possibly ruin stuff or hurt someone if it wasn't properly installed when the motor starts spinning.An added bonus is that the pulp container seems easier to remove and install without that blasted safety tab.Took me maybe 20 minutes, with soldering and heat shrink tubing. You can do it faster if you choose to just twist the wires together, ghetto style. Don't forget the electrical tape. As a matter of fact, writing this review took longer than the repair. I'll post some photos if I can figure it out.",

We needed something for basic use...toast, frozen waffles, grilled cheese, etc. I've never used anything but the lightest toast setting on this oven & it burns things black about 1/2 the time. It's like the setting may or may not be what you choose. The second week we had it, my husband put two slices of toast in on the lightest setting, then went upstairs to get my son out of bed & when he came back down, the toast was on fire. Flames were coming out the door, the top of the toaster was completely singed & we were lucky nothing else caught on fire. I'm extremely disappointed in this toaster oven. I think it's a dangerous product & wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I feel completely ripped off that I wasted money on it.I searched through the reviews again today, puzzled by the fact that so many thought it was wonderful when we've had such an awful experience with it. However, when I filtered by the 1 star reviews I saw that several people have had the same problems with this toaster, so it obviously has some issues.

        "Review": "First, the imperfections.1.  The unit comes packed with a paper insert between the bowl and the interior.  You are supposed to remove it before cooking in the unit.  This is all well and good, but the insert is held in place with a small dab of adhesive which seems impossible to remove from the plastic interior, and from the shiny, golden-colored outside of the bowl onto which it migrates after the first use of the unit.  Not a big deal, but not perfect, either.2.  There is an overflow tray for water condensate that is very small, which must be emptied after each use.  After I cooked my first batch of barley in the unit, I removed the tray and it was completely full of condensate with fiber scum from the barley.  Some of the scummy water may have spilled onto the counter and run under the unit when I pulled out the tray.  Alternatively, it may have run over during use.  From my experience with cooking barley in traditional, non-pressure, non-IH, rice cookers, I can say it was an extremely small mess relatively speaking.  However, I think the tray should be big enough to not run over when removed when following, exactly, the instructions in the manual.3.  There doesn't seem to be any way to abort cooking except by unplugging the unit from the wall.  This does result in an automatic release of pressure and a clearing of the program, for which I am thankful.Now the good points.1.  Barley, the cooking of which was my reason for buying the unit, cooked perfectly using the instructions in the manual.  It was just a little chewy, but completely cooked.  Barley froths a lot because of its high soluble fiber content, and as mentioned above, the scummy mess resulting from the frothing barley was very, very small.2.  An experiment I attempted with wheat berries and frozen fruit, that did not follow any instructions anywhere and wasn't even done the way I originally intended, resulted in a small amount of slightly cooked wheat covered in slightly caramelized fruit syrup.  The unit's timer stuck at 10 minutes, probably because the mixture had gone all but dry and the temperature controller could no longer sense anything.  I aborted the cooking by unplugging the unit when I started to smell what I felt was surely baking sugar syrup.  Wonder of wonders, the barely cooked wheat was delicious, and the cooking bowl practically rinsed clean.  There was absolutely no sticking.  I consider this to be a commendable recovery from a bad user error.3.  The color of the unit is gorgeous.  The picture is not lying; it is a wonderful deep red metallic color.  I wish my car was that color, but that wasn't a choice so my car is black.  My rice cooker, however, is beautiful.Now for some tips that I wish I had found before I tried experimenting.1.  The rice cooker \"cup\" that comes with this unit is 3/4 of a US cup.2.  The 6-cup unit is described as large enough to make 6 servings.  This is the old-fashioned meaning of servings, as in \"serves 6\".  Back in the old days, packages which said they served 6 actually did satisfy 6 people at the dinner table.  A combination of food marketing and the US government has resulted in a new meaning for this.  6 servings is now 6 portions, each of which contains about 100 calories so that the product can be advertised as containing 100 calories per serving.  The fact that the government's dietary recommendations may say that you should consume 6 of these portions, called \"6 servings\", per day gets lost somewhere along the way.  If you tried to serve 6 people with 6 modern US servings of anything, you would either have 6 starving diners or 1 happy diner and 5 angry ones.  So anyway, when this unit's manual refers to 4 servings, they mean \"enough to feed 4\", not some dinky little dab intended to fool people into thinking they are getting more for their food-purchasing dollars than they are, and eating fewer calories than they can possibly exist upon.3.  The smallest amount of any grain, and legumes are apparently counted as grain for this purpose, that can be cooked in this unit is 2 servings, or 2 rice-cooker cups of raw grain.  This is 1.5 US cups of raw grain.  Plan accordingly, for your purposes.  By the way, you cannot cook less grain and make up the difference in volume with frozen berries.  Especially if you slip and start the cycle on \"plain rice\" instead of one of the slower-cooking mixture settings.",

        "Review": "Summary: not happy and honestly, somewhat frightenedCoffee.  Every morning at least two big, big cups.  For over seven years however I was very pleased each day with the flavor with my Black & Decker 5 cupper.  Originally, I think I just happen to find it at a local store, was the right size for my office.  It made better coffee than my full size rig at home.. very impressive for a little economy auto drip I thought.  And then it happened, about a month ago the carafe broke and I always knew that someday it would.  Incidentally, there was an acceptable amount of rust on the burner for a 7 year-old unit.  It looked like about the same price for a new maker as it would for just a replacement carafe so I went for it knowing I would be replacing both parts at some point.  An exact match for my favorite little model was nowhere to be found but there were at least 10 nearly identical 5 cup makers on the market.  So I picked one, not the cheapest and not the fanciest, and bought it.Shipping was quick.  I brewed the recommended no-grounds pot and almost passed out from the smell coming from the device and the produced hot water.  Emitting from the maker and the output water was a plastic odor that was more offensive than many cleaning products.  I tried making another pot of just water but it was still reeking beyond believe.  I made several pots of coffee (and by coffee I mean completely discussing, hot brown plasticky liquid to borrow from another person's review of a different B&W; model).  And after that then more pots of just water, all of which came out with a terrible plastic smell.  Honestly, I tried a cup of the coffee at one point but couldn't finish it due to the smell.B&D; customer service was not bad.  I was told that there were no similar issues on file based on the model and lot number.  They sent me an upgrade model.The DCM675WF didn't smell quite as bad but it is definitely not okay either.  Same basic observations; it makes smelly hot water for couple of cycles.  Then attempting brewing coffee is something that just shouldn't ever happen.  Beautiful fresh ground beans are run through the machine and out comes hot, coffee-like plastic-smelling water.  Again, tried to drink one cup, couldn't finish it because of the odor.  Honestly, I am slightly worried for my safety just from two partial cups.  And worse, there are probably people with diminished sense of taste (i.e. smokers) drinking pot after pot out of these things with no idea that the Chinese plastic is leaching things into their coffee that didn't even have names 10 years ago let alone any health impact studies.Black & Decker please, please be responsible and take the initiative to monitor and restrict materials used for your products, particularly your food-related products.  US government and rest of world's nations and corporations, please begin to monitor for and ban inferior plastics for food-related products.  If someone from the media is reading this please contact me so that we can do an expos&eacute; piece should I survive so long.",

I'm not quite sure how I feel about this mixer being the high point of my entire week when it arrived, but I suppose now that I've hit 30 there are some things I need to come to terms with.  I'm the kind of woman that loves to cook but hates to clean up.  This thing is a breeze to clean - although I must say I wish the whisk could be put in the dishwasher.  I've had minor issues with things splashing out so I do believe I will get the mixing/pouring shield.  I love the wide variety of attachments available - I'm considering getting the slicer attachment to make hash browns/french fries/au gratin potatoes.  I'd wondered about the amount of real estate this mixer would take up on my countertop, but it's not too bad.  As for being factory-reconditioned, I did not notice any flaws with my machine.  No scratches, dings, nothing.  Ah, in the for what it's worth department if you're giving one of these mixers as a gift it will arrive in a box that plainly states it is \"factory-reconditioned\".  We recently teamed up with friends to buy some mutual friends a mixer as a wedding gift, but they didn't mind at all - were delighted to get the mixer.In short, you should buy it - you won't regret it!",

The first unit I had failed early - bought a second unit - the wiring to a safety interlock had a cheap push-on connector that make poor contact thus over heated - yet another repair.The internal design is poor - they use two circuit boards when one would make the system more reliable and less costly.  The quality of push-on connectors used was 3rd class - not quality parts.The basic idea of using a switching power-supply is a good one - less shipping weight, more efficient etc.The user interface is so-so - sensor reheat adds value to this unit. Forcing the user to push four buttons to start up a 1:10 heating is just lame. Much better would have been a rotary input that would increment by larger counts the faster it was pressed.  This could also be done with two push buttons - labeled plus and minus so a press increments 10 sec - press and hold an it starts to increment by 1min.

Their suggestion was to prewarm the carafe...on a programmable grind and brew.Since the machine is still under warranty, I will attempt to contact support again.

        "Review": "This coffee maker looks amazing!  But...1.  Brew strenght button stopped working within the first 2 weeks2.  On/Off light stays on regardless of being pushed or unplugged and plugged back in3.  Other function lights glow, or don't, at random times4.  Coffee is drinkable warm after being brewed but definately is NOT hotAND the big one for me...5.  The strength of the coffee is weak not matter what setting I put it onWith 1-3 I understand the unit is defective.  Number 4, it started out almost hot but after a few days, it went to nicely warm and has stayed that way.  But number 5 is why I won't try this one again.To be fair, I like my coffee stronger than most normal people.  To put things in perspective, I used a Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee maker for 3 1/2 years and went through 2 of them that's why I tried this Black & Decker, I don't want to keep replacing them.  With the Mr. Coffee, I would grind 8 cups worth of beans and add 2 1/2 cups of water, that was perfect for me.  Using the Black & Decker, I tried the same &#34;mixture&#34; turning the brew strength selector on as well as the 2-4 cup option (please note that both option canNOT be used at the same time).  There was no difference in taste between the 2 settings but  was a little warmer with the 2-4 cup setting and more importantly, both settings make very weak tasting coffee compared to the Mr. Coffee I used to use.  I then tried grinding 12 cups worth of beans and kept to the 2 1/2 cups of water and the results were the same.  Yes, my coffee was a little better tasting but not really strong and definately not as strong the other machine would make.  I'm seriously wasting money with the amount of beans I'm running through!  I was simply trying to find a coffee maker that would last and at the same time looked great.  I'm going to try a higher end brand next.Just a few observations I would like to point out for those of you who aren't as picky about the taste of their coffee:The carafe is great to pour with, almost sleek in its ability!  Might sound strange but try it and you'll understand.When pouring, I haven't had water or coffee running down its side so no messy counter and no scortched heating pad.The cord storage was invaluable because the machine didn't fit under my cabinets so it had to be put out in the open.It was quite easy/straight forward to program (I didn't need the instructions).The carafe is housed nicely with just a little wiggle room so I never had a problem with trying to line anything up when I turned it on.I haven't had it long enough to use the cleaning feature so I can't tell you anything about that.And lastly, it takes a little more percision to pour water into the water reservior.  The design of the carafe helps with that.  What I didn't like was the fact that the water fill line is only visible on the left side of the machine and is marked in increments of 2 cups (line marks at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 cups).That's all, I hope it was helpful.",

        "Review": "This is a winner!  I have 30 years of Crock-Pot and other slow cookers experience. The Crock-Pot brand is my favorite & this one is the best of all the slow cookers I've owned.  The heating distribution is perfect. The oval shape is much more practical than the round shape. The shut off cooking control timer is precise - just remember the pot is still hot & will continue to cook while it cools. The removeable stoneware for washing is a huge bonus!  The lid locks to keep food from spilling during transportation. Great item for those pot-luck suppers!  I had been using a 4 quart crock-pot in another brand for a few years, but it only held enough food for 2-3 medium size appetities. The heat distribution was poor. The stoneware was not removeable which made cleaning difficult & awkward. I decided to get a the 6 quart Crock-Pot in order to make larger meals & freeze leftovers. The six quart size is the standard size for crockery cooking recipes. Just made a hearty beef & vegetable stew in it. I like my stew to be thick - the kind of stew that is eaten with a fork and a spoon. My recipe was from a well known country cooking magazine. The recipe filled the crock pot to the top with ingredients. Because this crock pot has a rubber seal that holds in more moisture than other slow cookers, next time I will reduce the broth by about 1/8 cup. But, that is a personal preference. I had read reviews and comments about an odor when using it the first time. There was a slight odor when the crock pot got really hot, but it was barely noticeable - the odor was from the rubber seal getting very hot for the first time. No one noticed the smell except me. If I hadn't been expecting an odor, I wouldn't have noticed it. My kitchen is large and open. Slight odor might be more noticable in a small enclosed kitchen. Don't let the comments about an odor influence your decision. I plan to order another one as a Christmas gift. Easy to read directions. Please DO read the directions! Clean up is a breeze. Cook time is accurate to recipes. Heat distribution is even. Locking lid is perfect for transporting food. Best shape for crockery recipes. Very happy with this item!",

So far I have had no problem cooking anything else.They clean up easily with a scrubby sponge. Do not use steel wool. There is an instruction sheet to tell you about how best to clean them.When I saw them used on several Food Network shows I was convinced that they would be right for me.The only things I would like to see changed are the lids. I like glass lids so I can monitor what I am cooking. I also like the lids to have vent holes. I seldom see that. The handles could be a little thicker. I am used to \"comfort grip\" handles.These pots and pans as we used to call them are solidly built.

        "Review": "So my Black and Decker blender stopped working in the middle of my making applesauce from scratch, so I had my husband stop on his way home from work and pick up a new blender. After reading reviews on Amazon, Target and WAlmart's websites I had concluded that ALL blenders are basically pieces of junk, so I told him to buy the cheapest one he could find and we'd just use it until it broke, then buy another, and repeat as necessary. What I REALLY wanted was a Blendtec or Vitamix, but those were so expensive it seemed silly to pay that price for a blender. I thought buying a ton of cheapo blenders would still be cheaper than a good one. Darling Husband brought home this Oster 10-speed, and I put it to use right away.I filled it with already food-processed and COOKED, teeny-tiny bits of apple and apple juice/water, just wanted to blend for a smoother texture. Plenty soft, plenty liquidy, should be SUPER easy to blend, right?? Well the first blender-full DID blend, but it took close to a minute, and smelled like burning plastic from the moment I turned it on. I re-filled the blender with more applesauce, opened the window for some fresh, non-toxic air, and tried blending again. This batch never did end up blending, no matter the speed or setting. The bottom 1/2 inch was moving, but nothing else. I tapped the sides, and the top to get more applesauce to fall into the blades, but nothing worked, and the different \"speeds\" on the blender all sounded EXACTLY the same, no change in the sound of the motor. This time around, the smell of burning plastic changed into the smell of burning wiring, and so to prevent an electrical fire, and lung cancer, I turned off the blender, rinsed it out, shoved it back in the box and anticipated getting my 20 bucks back. Hubby and I decided maybe it WASN'T too big of an investment to get a Blendtec with an 8-year warrantee. Check out their website for their roadshow locations so you can get a big discount on a SUPER AWESOME blender. I now have one of my own, and am enjoying smoothies EVERY DAY! NO SMELL! NO FIRES!

        "Review": "I own many Cuisinart products and was excited to find this item. I readily purchased it from bed bath & beyond. The excitement ended there. The first time I used it it leaked oil everywhere. The lid while looks pretty is a terrible design. It hangs over the edge of the pan so as oil splatters up on the sides of the lid it drips down the sides of the base. NOT GOOD! The lid fogs up really quick and you don't see much so the fact that it's clear doesn't help any. They need to redesign the venting at the top to allow more air to flow faster so that the lid doesn't fog up. The heating pan is also a bad design. The stirring arm motor is too weak and towards the end of the popping cycle it will not stir the corn so you'll get some burnt at the end. Also the pan has ridges all around the edge which match the lid design so uncooked kernels find refuge here and don't pop. Again bad design. I've used it about a dozen times and I haven't had anything break such as the handle locks as others have reported, but it's a mess to clean up due to bad lid/base design.So since I was disappointed I began my hunt again for another popper. I found the Westbend Kettle Krazy and bought it from Amazon thinking hopefully the design is better. It arrived and I quickly washed it and set it up. I immediately noticed that the lid atleast fits inside the pan, thank goodness... I knew the dripping oil wouldn't be an issue anymore. I popped my first batch and it was amazing! I couldn't believe how different the two units functioned. The pan shape is so much better and the stirring arm is very strong and I think it would stir through anything! I then made kettle corn, yes that's right, kettle corn just like you'd get at the local fair. 3tbs corn oil, 3/4 C mushroom kernels, 1/3 sugar. Add oil, let heat for 2 min, add kernels. When first kernel pops add sugar, sprinkling evenly over kernels and quickly replace lid. Once popped, salt to taste and shake to mix. There you have it, perfect kettle corn. I tried this in the Cuisinart and it just burnt, mainly because the stirring arm motor isn't very strong and made a mess. It also was hard to clean the lid & the cooking pan. BUT the Westbend performed like a champ!!! There was almost no clean up at all. The teflon coating on the pan is amazing and nothing sticks to it. The coating on the EasyPop sucks and sticking is inevitable.Go with the Westbend Kettle Krazy, You'll be glad that you did!!!",

        "Review": "The first thing I noticed when I pulled this coffee maker out of the box, was that it looked an awful lot like those coffee makers you find in hotel rooms.  If you've ever wondered why coffee always tastes bad when you try to make it in a hotel, it's not the coffee as I am finding out.I read the other reviews that said the coffee tastes metallic, or just didn't taste good.  I figured people were being picky, and just bought it anyway figuring it couldn't possibly be that bad.  It is.  It wouldn't matter what brand coffee you put in this thing, it would still all taste the same.  I'm not sure if it's the stainless steel carafe or not, but it certainly doesn't taste good.The coffee maker itself is fairly easy to use, and very cute.  I've read some reviews complaining about spillage, and though I didn't notice any spillage, the construction itself seems rather cheap.  I don't like that there isn't a beep to notify you the coffee is done.I'd say that the flaws of this coffee maker are what you should expect for the price, but I paid 30 bucks for it and I think that's a good amount of money to pay for a tiny coffee maker and expect that it be of good quality.  I bought a $6.00 no-brand coffee maker once that tasted better then this, and lasted a very long time.  I suppose this one will just have to do until I can fork out 80 bucks for a better one.",

        "Review": "I purchased my Traeger grill about 2 months ago based on a recommendation, and I would not recommend a Traeger grill to anyone due to quality control issues. The design of the grill is fine, but the poor quality of Chinese construction has made use of this grill an exercise in frustration. I think Traeger is trying to mass produce a grill at an affordable price by sacrificing quality, but there comes a point where the grill isn't worth buying regardless of cost. If it is always broken there's no sense in owning it.After owning the grill for three weeks one of the handles attached to the grill came loose. The attachments are concealed, so I contacted Traeger to make sure I would not void the warranty if I disassembled the grill and re-attached the handle. Traeger out-sourced its customer service department staff, and although the new support staff are friendly, they apparently know little about how the grill is assembled. It took three phone calls before I talked with someone who understood how the grill was assembled and who could tell me how to dis-assemble the grill as needed. With some effort I was able to tighten the handle.Two weeks later I started the grill, waited for it to pre-heat and put on the salmon steaks. When I checked on the grill 5 minutes later I found smoke billowing out of the pellet hopper - and the actual BBQ was cold. I turned off the grill and scooped smoldering pellets out of the hopper. The gasket that seals the hopper to the auger had come loose and was slowing being pulled into the auger that feeds the grill. This lack of an airtight seal caused a backdraft. To me this is a safety issue. The grill was / is not usable until Trager sends a new gasket. The replacement will require more disassembly. I've ordered the replacement gasket 4 times and have yet to receive it. The first time it wasn't shipped. The second time I was shipped the wrong part. The third time it was never shipped although I was told it would ship via overnight freight. The 4th time it was shipped regular mail although I was told it would be shipped overnight. I have yet to receive it.Traeger is obviously experiencing growing pains, and in the process is sacrificing quality control. Until these issues are all resolved I would not recommend this product, and would suggest that a potential buyer look at other more dependable products. The company's intentions seem to be good, but the outcome is not.",

        "Review": "This is a fairly typical, cheap cookware set that you may get a few years at best out of. It does have some high points and low points, but more low for me. I liked the glass lids, but the handles are always needing tightening. The griddle is a great addition to the set, but the larger skillet is still too small for what I'd prefer when there's already a small skillet included. The cookie pan is small and burns stuff too easily. The worst issue I had though was the first time I tried boiling water in the stock pot to make some pasta. The darn thing started smoking and set off the fire alarm! It let a pretty awful smell behind too, no idea what caused it, but won't be using that one ever again! I also don't find the dimpling helps particularly much with it being non-stick. I have a small smooth-surface Calaphalon skillet that I use for omelets that performs better.Overall, this was a disappointing set of cookware, ideally spend a little more and pick out a higher quality set and you'll save money not having to replace it as often, if at all!",

        "Review": "Bought this a week ago to do some juicing from home.  I've used it about 3 times a day since I bought it.  Here are my thoughts as of now, and I will update in a few months.PROS:* Easy to set up out of the box.* Very quiet when you turn it on.* Creates very little foam so there's no need to strain.* Doesn't heat up the juice like other juicers will.* Great with harder fruits and veggies (e.g., carrots, beets, apples, sweet potatoes, ginger root)* Not ridiculously expensive.* Easy to clean as far as juicers go (I wash by hand).* Doesn't take up much counter space.CONS:* Doesn't produce as much juice as other juicers I've owned (and those were all cheaper juicers).* Doesn't come with a cleaning brush (I had to buy a grout cleaner brush for the mesh filter - regular sponges won't do the job).* Gets LOUD and SHAKES when juicing softer fruits and leafy greens.* Spout is too low to put most cups/pitchers under to catch the juice - meaning you have to hold the cup/pitcher when trying to put the fruit/veggie down the chute. Or put a book underneath which isn't ideal.  Awkward!* When I tried to put bigger pieces of fruits/veggies down the chute they would get stuck instead of being processed through the mesh filter - so I've reverted to cutting everything up into smaller pieces to avoid jamming the chute.  Sort of a waste of a big opening.* The spout itself is awkward and falls off too easily.  Once I put it in incorrectly and juice ended up pouring out of the sides of the machine!Bottom line:  For the price and the quality of the no-foam juice you get this isn't a bad juicer.  But there are a lot of annoying design problems with the machine.  If you really want to make juice at home (I like to in order to save $$) it's a good buy but if you're not a regular juicer or if you're okay with smoothies instead of juice this might frustrate too much to make it worth it.+++ UPDATE +++ UPDATE +++So after about two weeks of using the machine 1-2x per day the thing isn't working anymore.  It won't turn on.  After reading other reviews and the instructions that came with I think the problem is the safety mechanism that prevents the machine from starting when the machine isn't assembled correctly. I've tried taking it apart and putting it back together a dozen times and no luck.  SOOOO frustrating since I already cut up all the fruits and veggies I was going to juice.  Argh!",

The rep assured me that all you have to do is remove the kettle from the base and the heater clicks off. That made sense to me so I ordered.As soon as I unpacked it, I plugged it in, pressed the \"on\" button, and the light went on. I immediately removed the kettle from the base and the light went off, so I assumed it was no longer heating. Just in case, I unplugged it,then plugged it back i, thinking it was still off since the light was off.Half an hour later I came back and happened to touch the outside of the kettle and it was hot. The pot was STILL on in spite of the fact that I had lifted it from its base, unplugged it, and replugged it in with no \"on\" light on. There was no water in the kettle either; so much for the safety feature that it shuts off automatically as soon as it's empty.In spite of what the customer service rep told me, the 72-page manual (72 pages to boil water? Granted it's in 11 languages, but slight overkill) clearly states, \"If the boiling process is ended by removing the main plug from the electrical outlet, the kettle will immediately switch itself back on when the main plug is reinserted.\" What kind of a design or safety function is that?The one and only plus of this product is the beautiful style with its nice lines and bright colors. Sadly it's the only reasonably priced modern kettle I could find. That's not enough to make up for the extreme safety hazard, of course. Needless to say, I'm returning this item immediately.

It has become difficult to find one that works on the stovetop or any open fire without electricity. I read one of the reviews for the Arcosteel 18/10 Stainless Steel Percolator also sold on Amazon. The reviewer complained about the pot rusting. I have not had a problem with rusting with this one and I have lived on a boat on salt water. I did have a problem with the plastic top that I suspect everyone that has had one has. They can melt. Too bad they dont correct this. I found a generic one of glass that fits and works perfect. I lost the strainer that fits atop the basket years ago, while washing it in the ocean, and it still works fine. Let the pot sit for a minute after removing it from the fire and any grounds in the coffee will settle to the bottom. Even if you dont have beans especially ground for a percolater as I normally don't. I find the coffee to be richer and hotter than the electric type. You can vary the amount of grounds as well as the time to perk to get your desired strength. Dont forget it and let it boil dry or you will have to throw it away.

We cook hamburgers, chicken, steaks on one side; eggs, pancakes, and pretty much anything else we can think of on the other.  Easy to clean (like most cast iron) and found a place to put it that wasn't in the way (see below).  We definitely recommend this product.  We also bought a loaf pan by Lodge. Also good.************UPDATE 20 Dec 2013 - This is a gas stove, using two 8,500 BTU burners.  I heat griddle with both on high for 3-5 minutes, then reduce both burners to medium-low (half way between medium and low).  Thanks for the great question.************Short History: I really enjoy cooking on cask iron and wanted a griddle for some time, so when I saw this with the plethora of good reviews I bought it.Comment to Bad reviews:Uneven cooking - I have not found it to cook unevenly (find me a pan that is perfect at this).  I preheat the griddle with two EQUALLY SIZED burners (maybe this is their problem) for several minutes before cooking and it works great.  I have used it for chicken and pancakes so far.Stove gets hot - Really!?  Seriously?!  A stove gets hot?  This does not get any hotter than cooking with any of the other pans or woks I use and cools just as rapidly.Cons:I don't like it being pre-seasoned.  Having owned cask iron products, I don't find it overbearing to season one and in fact enjoy preparing them for all the wonderful years of cooking.  I cleaned this one as much as possible with steel wool to remove the seasoning, but atlas it barely scratched it.  Oh well.Pros:Convenience: Finally I can \"whup up a mess o\" pancakes and it takes me 25% of the time it did.  4-6 pancakes at a time.  Chicken for whole family at once.  This really is a time saver as it is a convenient cooking surface.Thoughts:  I knew I would need a place to let it cool and to store it before buying and placing on my tiny stovetop and I am finding it a slight challenge for now.  But again, I knew this BEFORE buying it.Overall: I would buy it again and recommend it to others.",

        "Review": "I have owned multiple KitchenAid mixers over the last few decades. KitchenAid was once on the short list of companies that could be counted on to stand behind their products.Picture me working away on some holiday baking with the help of my newest and most fabulous KitchenAid mixer from the 600 series. Now picture the entire front, bottom piece of said mixer suddenly breaking off and bouncing off the bowl, which sent both the bowl of dough and the large piece of mixer clattering across the floor. Quite the surprise!The mixer was over a year old, but rarely used compared to my smaller Artisan mixer. The big gun, the KitchenAid 600, was reserved for big jobs, so it was next to brand new when it disintegrated before my eyes.It turns out the Professional 600 mixer has a known defect that causes the appliance to fail. If you do a little research, you will easily find multiple complaints about the \"planetary gear output shaft assembly\" (aka PGOSA) uncoupling from many models of KitchenAid mixers that have elliptical movement.I called KitchenAid customer service and explained what had happened. The customer service person acknowledged the issue, but advised me that it happens \"very rarely.\" She really seemed to think I would find it comforting to learn that in the whole time (almost one year!) she has worked for KitchenAid, I was only the third person she had spoken to about the problem.I cared as much about being \"only\" the third person as much as she cared about hearing I had used my mixer less than twenty times before it failed. It did not matter to her at all.Despite the almost new condition of the mixer and the multiple references to the mixer having a known defect, KitchenAid will not fix or replace my mixer because it is over a year old and out of warranty.For the record, I understand what it means to be out of warranty and know KitchenAid is well within their rights to blow me off. Since I am out of warranty, I am at their mercy and have no recourse regardless of how many times I have used (or not used) the mixer. I also understand that some companies choose to stand behind their products if they are aware of a problem.Sony is a great example. They handled all costs of repairing a television of mine that was WAY out of warranty. In fact, they told me about the defect and offered repair immediately, no hassle. Sony is now the only television I buy just because I know they stand behind what they sell.I subsequently wrote KitchenAid pleading my case and again citing multiple references to the known defect, but I received no reply. I resent the letter to the customer service address, plus sent a copy to Whirlpool's corporate address. Again, I was completely ignored; not even the courtesy of a reply. I have stopped holding my breath waiting for a reprieve.Chances are if you buy this mixer, you will not have a problem. But, think about what might happen if you do have a problem. KitchenAid used to stand behind their products, but being gobbled up by Whirlpool obviously changed that. I encourage you to check out Viking and Cuisinart mixers.",

You can make a lot of rice with this cooker...It also can be used to steam vegetables which makes for a nice double duty.  Easy to use and easy clean up.  I can tell we will be using this for a long time. (You just put the rice and water in, turn it on, and forget about it until the rice is done. Nothing sticks to the pan...it's great.) I would hand wash the pan because the wonderful non-stick quality would surely be ruined by an electric dishwasher.",

        "Review": "On purchasing the CPK-17 Cuisinart perfect temp kettle, our first thought was its expensive. However at this price it would last and do the job we really wanted.For 12 months it did, after that is began to turn off early, two months later it would heat intermittently for over 25 minutes and never boil at all. We contacted Cusinart and asked them what we should do. They said that our kettle \"was defective and still under warranty\" and we would have to send them $15 and they would send another one, also we would have to pay guaranteed insured postage on the old one and send it back.Now we may be living in a different realm, but if a company tells you that their product is \"defective\" and \"under warranty\" why is it that we are having to pay a considerable amount to get a working model.  On writing back stating this we got a reply some time later with the standard \"Valued Customer\" saying yes under the circumstances we will waive the $15 but you pay the rest.This is the third time we have had a product break down, each time we have received a replacement item in the mail, (in the case of Braun it was a much more expensive item and they just wanted us to be satisfied.That is beyond anything we would expect and outstanding customer service.)Look on most web sites and its \"free shipping\" so why is it that an expensive \"defective\" item is going to cost the \"valued customer\" in shipping.We would have thought that if we were indeed \"valued Customers\" sending a replacement item with a return shipping label would have been the thing to do.We now have a \"defective\" expensive kettle, and no further customer service, which leads us to believe we were not that \"valued\" and to know we will no longer be \"customers\" of Cuisinart products in the future.",

        "Review": "This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.",

        "Review": "This is a good sized set of pots for a single, a couple, or a larger group, if you add more pieces. The small frying pan worked very well to cook two over easy eggs. They did not stick at all, I used about a half teaspoon of butter and got great results. The long handled, larger fry pan did a great job on cooking some brocolinie. I used two cups of water and put the lid on and brought it to a boil. The water heated quickly on my gas burner and the lid was tight and held in the steam. The directions say to put the lid ajar after shutting off the burner to avoid creating a vacuumed seal, and also never to use lids from other sets. The lids seal tightly for quick boiling, but they do not have a vent hole.The larger Sauce pans were not really large enough to cook a pot of sauce for a larger family. Would never do for an Italian 2PM Sunday pasta dinner. They would work fine enough if you are only cooking one pound of pasta and a small batch of sauce. The largest saucepan will fit a full ear of corn, but the next size down is too small. You would have to break the ears in half to make them fit and it would only hold about 3 to 4 ears. Okay for a small family, not good for a family of six, or for when the grandkids come for dinner.I like the height of the handles on the glass lids. They are high enough to accommodate the silicone fingertip glove-like pot holders. You do need some sort of pot holder, as the handles get really hot.Reading the paperwork I was disturbed to see that you should not have small pets or birds anywhere near the cooking area when using these pots. I do not have small animals, however, if it is dangerous to bird immune systems and their lungs, can it be okay if you have an infant or a toddler in a high chair in the kitchen?They other con to this set is that it is not dishwasher safe. You can go from stove top to oven without a problem.After using this set for a few weeks, I am adding one star. Nothing sticks, all the pans are very easy to clean. I had left a pan on the burner and the water boiled away. I thought I would have to throw it out. However, a quick wipe with a soapy sponge and it cleaned up nicely.The directions say that you can use metal utensils, however, I will not chance it and risk having flecks of pan come off in our food.",

        "Review": "My husband bought the Cuisinart Coffee on Demand coffee maker a year and a half ago.  It would leave coffee on the counter underneath the machine.  If the counter was white then even though all of the liquid was under the coffee maker, I would have noticed some of it.  This hadn't been obvious to me because I had granite counters.  Unfortunately, when I went to clean under the coffee maker for the first time, I found lots of wetness.  When I dried it I was apalled to see that it had stained my granite.  I was very upset and the counters weren't even that old.  Wiping didn't fix that stain but a combination of flour and dishwashing liquid per a recommendation ended up cleaning it.  My husband called Cuisinart and they had us send it in, pay $10 and getting a new one.  Unfortunately this one had the same exact thing.  My solution?  I put a puppy pad underneath it (trying to fold it so that none or very little of the pad pokes out).  What's funny is that I don't even have a dog - I would just buy them for this coffee maker.  I did this for ages.  It was a far from perfect solution but at least the water was getting drawn away from my counter and not spreading.  As I said, I did this for a long time - maybe about 15 months.  I find it annoying and just ran out of pads today.  Then an idea came to me - I have a small stainless steel cookie sheet.  It was part of a set of 3 that I had bought at WalMart.  I put the coffee maker in it and since the back in which you would see extra pan isn't visible where I have it, I think this will work out better than the pads since I can have total confidence that no water or coffee will leak on my counter.  It looks fine with the cookie tray and it's not obvious that it's not just a part of the coffee maker.  Bottom line: I never had a coffee maker that had problems before this one.  I'd never had anything fancy before (Mr. Coffee) and they would work fine.  This one costs over $100 and has a leak.  Don't go through the hassle.  I'm sure you can find something with a similar look that doesn't have this defect. As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to use mine until it conks out.  Whenever that happens, I'll research a different brand of coffee maker and not get Cuisinart coffee makers again.  They are a fine brand for other products but awful for this.  Hope this info helps someone.",

In addition, I was not satisfied with the claim of fitting a 12&#34; pizza.  I have a pizza pan that measures exactly 12&#34; in diameter and it does not fit in without wedging it in at an angle.  If you put the pizza directly on the tray, it probably would fit but it would be rubbing up against the sides of the interior.

While the price seems like a bargain, I guess the adage \"you get what you pay for\" is very true.  This mixer will not hold up under heavier doughs!  On this last mixer, I was mixing up a batch of stiff buttercream for a wedding cake.  The motor was starting to get hot (which wasn't unusual, because the motor on this mixer runs hot all the time, even under light loads) and all of a sudden it gave a horrible grinding noise and the beaters seazed up and refused to turn anymore. ...the same exact thing that had happened on my first Mixmaster also.I can't imagine that 350 watts isn't sufficiant to mix buttercream.  I can only think that the plastic parts inside became heated and finally cracked and broke under the strain.  Lousy craftsmanship!  Doesn't anyone do all metal gears anymore?This time, I'm going to invest a little money and possible buy a Kitchenaid.  Maybe it will last longer than a year.",

        "Review": "This unit makes a good cup of coffee. Unfortunately it has major design flaws. The water tank is too big for the carafe, so if you fill it all the way, it dumps coffee everywhere. Even if you carefully keep it below the 12 cup mark, it overflows. You need to fill it to 11, or a good 1\" below full. It also doesn't have the 'steal a cup' feature that lets you pour a cup while it's still brewing. I don;t care about stealing a cup, but when it's running all over the counter it would be nice to make some room in the carafe.The carafe: as mentioned previously, it's a PITA to completely drain it. The lid is also not ergonomic; the indicator for which way to align it for pouring is very hard to see, and if you pour with it the wrong way, it leaks all over the place from the vent holes. Those same holes leak all over if you tip it too much when pouring, which you will, because it pours so slow.Amazon, please stop selling this junk.TerryB",

        "Review": "When I looked at this blender before purchasing, I had read the conflicting reviews between those who loved it and those who had issues. For the price, I decided that the benefits would outweigh the risks, so I purchased it. For the first 6 months, the blender worked great and I had no complaints. However, after the 6-month mark, it started making a strange sound when blending. I immediately stopped, but could not find the exact source of the issue. Upon the next use, the blender was working fine for the first 2 minutes, but then started smelling and SMOKING. Well, that was the end of this blender.Because of the nature of the warranty, it is not worth replacing. The company requires that you pay shipping BOTH WAYS, meaning that it's more expensive to have them replace it than it is to buy a new one. I will likely buy a different blender next time, perhaps from a company that provides a better warranty process. I knew the warranty process before purchasing, but to sell a product that wound up almost causing a fire and expecting me to pay shipping both ways (rather than just the shipping to them), seems like it's asking for a lot. If I buy a cheap blender, I can imagine having the parts wear out or break easily, but not to the extent that it poses such a risk.",

        "Review": "Thank goodness for Amazon's good return policy! The UPS man was at my door with a return label in his hand on the first weekday after I filled in the online return forms.My old Oster convection/toaster oven died after many years of daily use by me and abuse by other members of the family. After hours of comparing I decided on this one, partly based on the great design and reliable performance of the other Oster.In the first place, the oven came with two defects.1. The cord was stowed under the oven to pack it and the very stiff insulation had cracked at the bend. This is a design/materials defect, not a glitch in manufacture. All these ovens would have the same crummy stiff insulation on the cord, and would be packed with the same tight bend.2. The fan was so carelessly installed that it not only gave out the whoo-whoo moan of a severely unbalanced fan, but hit something at certain temperatures, as the various oven parts heated up and expanded. I would guess from the numerous descriptions that this is partly a design issue as well as an assembly/quality control problem.The cord was excessively short and mounted way to the control panel side -- too bad if you don't happen to have an outlet very near the right side of the oven. I would think that a cord that came cracked would soon disintegrate (especially as it not only gets very hot itself but was super-heated by the oven even though I taped the cord to the wall to try to keep the stiffly set bends from touching the oven.The fan was terrifically noisy -- about like trying to cook with one's head inside a jet engine-- aside from the whoo-whoo groan whine bap bap of its unbalance and knocking.When set at the default 350 degrees F, the oven took 40 minutes to reach 275 degrees, at which point the heat bars began cycling. (I measured with an absolutely accurate professional oven thermometer.) The oven never did reach 350, though it got above 300 degrees. As would the kitchen have had it been summer-- the air around the oven seemed as hot as that within it.Despite, or perhaps because of, the noisy fan, I could detect no air circulation inside the oven and no air flow through any vent.The top gets hot enough to fry eggs on -- far hotter than the old oven (a drop of water begins to show bubbles immediately but doesn't actually sizzle). The top coil is very close to the oven roof (ceiling?).The curved-out back got even hotter -- it blistered the paint behind the oven despite the air movement in my frigid, drafty kitchen. There is a little knob of silicone mounted to the back, but it's clearly not long enough to keep the oven at a safe distance from a wall.The huge glass door radiated so much heat that the oven would probably function quite well as a room heater. I'm sure one could broil a steak on the door, or bake tandoori bread. I didn't try a drop of water on the door, for obvious reasons, but I did accidentally knock a knuckle on it -- instant blister. The door is heavily spring loaded and came near catching my hand more than once while I was fiddling with the oven.The door handle clears the top of my deeper-than-most counter, so that the glass itself slams down on the edge of the counter.I tried toasting slices from a spare loaf of bread. Amazon may allow my picture to be added to the collection. Slices on the right side were pretty thoroughly blackened, those on the left burned on the edges, white in the middle, and thoroughly dried out.I've had a few Oster appliances in the past, all excellent. I can't imagine what they think they're playing at, cutting their quality to this point.",

NOT SO MUCH. The DAY we got them we used them, the teflon chipped off in the food, the red outside was now a charred black and grey color and the burner had almost burnt through the bottom of the pan.Being on a limited budget and not being able to afford another hundred dollars worth of pans we just decided to grin and bear the situation and cook our food on a lower temperature for a long period of time. which we shouldnt have to do but it was the only way to keep the teflon from flaking off the bottom of the pan. Soon there after my boyfriend was cooking and the bottom of the pan became engulfed in flames. It was so worn and frail that it just started on fire. Mind you, weve had these pans for 3 months. After almost burning our house down with the 2 foot flames i decided to write a nasty review to try and help those in search of new cookwear. Also, all the spatulas, slotted spoons, and ladles were good for one use before they became warped due to boiling water. Never had i seen that happen just from stirring noodles. So needless to say, unless you want to burn your house down and be ripped off, these pans probably arent for you.",

The burner area was red hot, the coffee in the pot was boiling, the plastic around the burner was melting, and smoke was pouring out of it.  My wife and I were both upstairs just before this incident and luckily she just happened to go downstairs and heard a \"Popping\" sound from the kitchen and was curious enough to investigate further.She pulled out the glass pot, unplugged the coffeemaker, and tossed it outside in the grass where it continued to smolder.  The smell of melted plastic and burned wire filled the kitchen.  IF THIS HAPPENED WITH US UPSTAIRS IT WOULD HAVE STARTED A HUGE KITCHEN FIRE; IF THIS HAPPENED WITH NOBODY HOME THE ENTIRE HOUSE COULD HAVE BURNED DOWN.After searching Google for \"Cuisinart coffeemaker fire\" I was blown away to find HUNDREDS of reports of the same exact thing happening to other people. Please do the search yourself before buying this coffeemaker.After this incident and reviewing the other reports of fire, I will NEVER buy a Cuisinart coffeemaker again.  I cannot believe that this coffeemaker has not been recalled.  When an electrical appliance fails, it should short out, not set itself on fire.If your Cuisinart DCC-1200 coffeemaker hasn't caught fire yet, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT *EVER* LEAVE THE POT UNATTENDED.  ALSO, I WOULD BE VERY AFRAID TO USE THE AUTO TIMER JUST IN CASE IT LIGHTS ITSELF ON FIRE BEFORE YOU WAKE UP; and keep a fire extinguisher handy.We reported this incident to the Consumer Product Safety Commission; hopefully they will force a recall and save someone's life. This is not a rare occurrence and Cuisinart's current response appears to be ignoring the problem and hoping that nobody gets hurt or killed.",

Now picture the entire front, bottom piece of the mixer suddenly breaking off, sending the bowl flying before bouncing off the counter-top and clattering to the floor. Quite the surprise! Buy this mixer and it could happen to you too.While it is not a common occurrence, the Professional 600 mixer has a known defect that causes the appliance to fail. If you do a little research on-line, you will see multiple complaints about the \"planetary gear output shaft assembly\" (aka PGOSA) uncoupling from many KitchenAid mixers that have elliptical movement. For layman's terms, see the above first paragraph.KitchenAid was once on the short list of companies that could be counted on to stand behind their products. For many people, including myself, KitchenAid's history of superior customer service was often the decision factor when purchasing both small and large appliances.As you may have guessed by now, my mixture is no longer within the one year warranty period. I offered to provide copies of the multiple references I found about the mixer's defect, but as it turns out, KitchenAid is well aware of the problem.The customer service person advised me that it happens \"very rarely.\" She really seemed to think I would find it comforting to learn that in the whole time (almost one year!) she has worked for KitchenAid, I was only the third person she had spoke to about the problem.I cared as much about being \"only\" the third person as much as she cared about hearing I had used my mixer less than twenty times before it failed. It did not matter to her at all.For the record, I understand what it means to be out of warranty and that KitchenAid is well within their right to blow me off.  Since I am out of warranty, I am at their mercy and have no recourse regardless of how many times I have used (or not used) the mixer. I also understand that some companies choose to stand behind their products if they are aware of a problem.Sony is a great example. They handled all costs of repairing a television of mine that was WAY out of warranty. In fact, they told me about the defect and offered repair immediately, no hassle. Sony is now the only television I buy just because I know they stand behind what they sell.I have written to KitchenAid pleading my case and am hoping for a reprieve, but am not holding my breath. KitchenAid used to stand behind their products, but being gobbled up by Whirlpool changed that. If you are looking for a top of the line mixer, consider theViking Professional 5 -quart Stand Mixer, BlackorCuisinart SM-55BC 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chrome.",

You can not fill the pot up or pour from it with the electrical cord attached or you risk the chance of electrical shock because the water will spill onto the cord/plug area. Therefore, every time you want to pour from it, or refill it with water to heat, you must unplug the cord from the pot and also from the wall outlet.I based my decision to purchase this unit solely on its cheap price.That was a mistake because I had to return it and purchase a different one. I made sure to purchase one that sits on a base and therefore you can fill it and pour from it without the worry of having an electrical plug attached to it and whether or not you may get it wet.

The cup is a nice shape  (a bit larger on the top; and it is easy to clean.It does smell like it wants to burn out if you hold it more than 1 second at a time.And holding it longer will cause more leakage on the top.Only takes about 4 to 5 seconds use to mix the protein powder - if mix more, tends to get overly foamy.I wish at times that it had a little less power so that could mix it all thoroughly  without clumps but not get quite as foamy. Sometimes I resort back to my blenderball because doing it by hand doesn't produce as much foam (depends some on the type of protein used too).",

Careful, it is not immersible.",

        "Review": "This is a piece of kitchen equipment with a very specialized purpose, preparing sugar solutions such as caramel, toffee, syrup for boiled frosting or divinity, and suchlike.  The purpose for using copper is its excellent conductivity.  Placed over a flame or electric element, a heavy copper vessel will conduct heat up the sides of the pan as well as through the bottom, helping to assure even heating. One of the problems with caramelizing sugar is that it is easy to get hot spots in the cooking vessel that will burn while the remainder of the mixture is not yet at the desired temperature.  Heavy copper minimizes this problem.Most people who are ready to lay out big bucks for a little copper pan are already familiar with its characteristics but for those who aren't, the Mauviel pans are solid copper, right down to the rivets, fabricated by hand, and produced in relatively small numbers.  The bottom is about 1/8th inch thick, the sides a bit thinner but still very substantial.  The handle is a cone of copper formed around a mandrel and soldered on the undersurface and to the mounting plate, which is then riveted to the pot.  That little bit of silver solder is the only part of the pot that is not pure copper.  Formed into the top of the pot is a pouring spout.  This is a right-handed pot though I am told that, for a suitable sum, Mauviel will make you a left-handed one.This pot is heavy when empty, doubly so when filled with boiling sugar.  That makes it dangerous for anyone who has weak wrists or is careless.  Sugar at 300F will burn skin instantly and is difficult to remove before the burn is a done deal.  Great care is needed.  Sugar pans are dangerous in another way, as well.  Remember how conductive copper is?  Remember what the handle is made from?  You got it!  The handle becomes extremely hot.  Because most of us are accustomed to insulated handles on cookware, it is perilously easy to grab the handle of the pot without a mitt or cloth and get a burned hand for your trouble.  If you jerk your hand away and spill the contents on yourself, the results could be catastrophic.If you only boil sugar a few times a year, this pot may not be a sound investment (though it has great foodie snob appeal).  If, on the other hand, you do a fair bit of confectionary work, it is a useful tool that becomes your great friend.  The \"I want one\" versus \"I need one\" ratio varies a lot from person to person...Just a few words about this particular pot.  It holds 1.9 quarts.  Two quarts of caramel?  That sounds like a lot.  It IS a lot and more on that in a second.  Boiling sugar foams and having it boil over the top of the pan is not a good thing.  For example, if you are making toffee and using the traditional formula of equal parts sugar and butter by volume, you will find that two cups of sugar and a pound of butter just about maxes out this pan.  Even with that limited amount, you will have to watch it like a hawk and turn the fire down low once it begins to boil.  That is not a bad thing since one of the most common errors made by beginning confectioners is trying to reduce the syrup too quickly.  That being said, two cups of sugar and an equal amount of butter makes a LOT of toffee.  Few home cooks will need a larger pan.  It doesn't make sense to buy a bigger one than you need because the already-high price goes way up and the pan becomes much heavier and harder to handle.some last thoughts about food safety.  Sugar pots are unlined, not because the contact of the sugar with the copper accomplishes anything magical but just because there is nothing to be gained by lining them, either inside or outside.  Sugar does not react with copper within the time and temperature parameters of candy-making.  The pot should not be pressed into service for cooking other foods, though, because copper does react with acidic materials.  Will this kill you?  No, but it will make your food taste bad and could conceivably give you an upset stomach.  Copper acetate, for example, is not a wholesome food product...About the only other use for unlined copper in the kitchen is the traditional bowl for whipping egg whites.  There is a longstanding conviction among many cooks that whites expand to greater volume and demonstrate increased stability when whipped in a copper vessel.  When I was in culinary school, two of our most respected instructors used to go at each other about this at regular intervals.  I've never noticed much difference.  Try it yourself and see what you think.Bottom line:  This pan is superbly designed and constructed for its intended purpose.  If you need one, you can order this one without hesitation.",

        "Review": "The many, detailed and thoughtful reviews were helpful in narrowing down the choice for a 200 sq living room area in the lower level of a tri-level house. I've had the WINIX 9500 for about a year now. Operating 24x7. The change filter (red) indicator came on a few days back, so did some cleaning of the prefilter and carbon filter (dusted and vacuumed in place of washing) . The reset filter indicator button is located at the front top (after the front cover is taken off). Push 3-5 seconds (per instruction) and it'll go off.Just wanted to elaborate on a couple of points in case it's useful:1. Auto mode. I gave a 4-star rating because I'm not too impressed by the auto mode. It's not too predictable. I have a work room in the lower level with table/mitre saws that generate a lot of dust, some of which escape when I open the door to the work room. Dust/odor detection comes on but not always when you think it should. It's not reliably auto. So I operate it in manual mode (set either to medium or low level).2. Noise. At low level, I could read a book in the lower level and not be significantly bothered. At medium level (I don't operate it at higher levels because I found no need to), the noise is clearly noticeable. Some people may be able to tune it out, others will not. Certainly a factor if in a bedroom setting where the house is quiet except for WINIX (and mice). And plasma mode makes a high frequency discernible noise (a bit like firewood crackling but at low intensity) which is separate from the low/medium air volume setting.3. Odor/dust removal capability. I bought the air filter mainly for odor removal (dust is not much of an issue except if I'm cutting wood in the work room). It does a good job at medium setting. Odor that intrudes from the basement (there's a separate basement which is below grade) into the lower level is removed. Low level setting helps but medium level is needed for the size of the living area to effectively remove musty smells. I turn the plasma mode always on as there is a noticeable difference odor wise.Overall, it is a good air filter. The noise level (up to medium setting) is acceptable. I also have dehumidifiers in the basement, and compared to those (which are \"quieter\" models in the 70 capacity category but still very noisy) it's day and night. The carbon filter makes a significant difference in odor removal. Didn't pay much attention to dust removal capability but the prefilter was quite dusty when I aired/dusted it outside.",

It was great, worked fine, looked spiffy on the counter top, until the day it started to show a minor water puddle underneath, on the heating platform. While at first, I did not pay it much attention, thinking it was just water that had spilled, I now know it is not so: the kettle will start to leak (at least the one I got does) at the seal for the on-switch, at the bottom of the kettle, below the water gauge. (the little nipple thingy). Now, the leak is so strong that I can only put water into it, boil it right away, then empty out whatever is left. That way, it does not have time to empty all its content out while boiling, just some. Any longer, and the entire kettle empties out to make a messy puddle.Too bad! Why make a quality stainless steel kettle with a nice design/form, and then put in a cheap made in China style seal around the movable part!?!Unfortunately, that is a typical situation with anything made in China. I've lived there and do business there all the time, trust me, I know what most of the country's manufacturing is like!They will take lots more time to grasp the meaning of \"quality manufacturing\" and \"quality control\".",

(Although I used to use a 28&#34; Grill before and miss that very much).- The main body of the Kettle is made of pretty sturdy steel and seem to hold off pretty well- The Ash assembly is pretty helpful for removal and cleaning and vent on the top was a good design ideaCons:- The legs on which the Kettle stands are made of cheap aluminum hollow tubes and are extremely flimsy in construction- Moreover, the legs tend to come off from the receptacles located on the kettle shell, easily if you try to move the kettle around and when that happens while the fire is already on, then that may pose a serious safety issue to fix that- The OEM Grill is not durable and became unusable after one season of use - despite thorough cleaning after every grilling session- The grate height is NOT adjustable which [if it were adjustable] would have helped grilling low heat tolerant items such a fish etc. betterOverall it is one of the best construction material among its competitors in the market but in its design there are plenty of room for improvement",

        "Review": "I have an old Cuisinart Little Pro Plus (3 cup size) that I bought 19 years ago when I moved into my first apartment.  This spring the plastic housing on the chopping blade broke such that the blade is unusable.  Now all it can do is shred and slice, which is very useful, but I wanted the chopping option.  I considered buying a replacement blade but decided to get a new food processor because some of the other plastic parts were starting to yellow with age so I suspect they will be next to break.  Plus I wondered if I should have a larger model since I cook all the time.  Our family has many food allergies - we NEVER eat out - so my kitchen appliances get a LOT of use.#1: First I tried ordering a Cuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7 Cup Food Processor from Amazon.  As soon as I unpacked it and played with it a little, I knew I had a problem.  The food pusher/shoot don't come completely apart.  This was a deal-breaker for me because 1) How could you ever get it clean between the pushers and 2) I like to pile stuff in and then push it down - this model won't start slicing at all until the one pusher is engaged, so you can't pile food in and then push it.  This model went right back.  How can they make a model where there are parts exposed to food that you can never get at to clean???  Baffling.#2: Second I tried a Cuisinart Elite Collection 12 Cup Food Processor.  This monstrosity of a food processor is a true workhorse.  It weighs a ton, so you'd better like the color you order.  You'll be seeing a lot of it on your counter.  Unless you are looking for extra weight lifting, you probably won't be motivated to move it into your pantry.  The good thing about the beast is it has a seriously powerful motor.  For a person who cooks a lot, that's a plus.  A fabulous thing about this model is the adjustable slicing disc.  LOVE that you can slice from thin to thick.  I'd use the thin for finely sliced vegetables in baked dishes and the thick for making oven roasted potatoes.So, the Good:1) strong motor2) ADJUSTABLE SLICING DISC3) comes in different colors (including white, which is what I wanted)4) I got mine on sale at Macy's, stacking coupons and discounts and it was less than $145There are several problems with this model for me, though:1) HEAVY (I mentioned this)2) BIG (I kind of mentioned this, but let me elaborate.  If you put this Food Processor bowl, cover, shoots, and pushers in the top of your dishwasher, that's it!  Nothing else will fit.  It is quite a commitment.  In theory, one could only wash the small bowl and not dirty up the large bowl, but that didn't work for me because:a) The large bowl always seemed to get dirty anyway just by being around all that food handlingb) The small bowl does not allow slicing or shredding, which is mostly what I use this forSome people really like the big work bowl because of how they use their food processor.  Personally, I have a VitaMix, so I would use that for most of my chopping needs and don't need a big work bowl, which seems most important when you are doing larger quantities of liquids.3) Holes in the discs.  Cuisinart told me on the phone that they've changed this as of the 2013 models, but the one I got had big holes in the discs that were designed to let you hold it easily with your fingers.  There were the perfect size for slim carrots or celery or the like to go straight through, never even seeing any slicing or shredding action.  Poor design.  Glad that the newer models fixed that.4) Large amounts of food remain unprocessed above the slicing and shredding blades.  I called Cuisinart on this; they said they haven't had complaints on that topic.  I even went downtown to a great cooking store and tried theirs out to see if I had a dud.  Their model did the same thing.  Incidentally, the sales woman said her old Cuisinart does the same thing.  My 19 year old little 3 cup Little Pro Plus didn't.  Specifically, if I'm shredding carrots, in my Little Pro I may end up with a 1 cm x 2 mm piece that doesn't get shredded.  In this Elite model, there was a 6 cm x 3 mm piece left on top, plus several others about that same size.  Not good.  If I wanted to shred the carrots by hand, I wouldn't have gotten out the food processor in the first place.5) Fancy, new wing-ding sealing feature.  What motivated Cuisinart to do this?  Okay, on my old model, if I overfill it with too much food sometimes bits will come out the top.  But that's if I overload it and it isn't that big a deal.  Conversely, they've created a pain-in-the-bottom ring seal where the bowl and cover fit together that is a problem to clean every time you use it.  Little bits of food get caught in there, which one can eventually get out with powerful water spraying, their special cleaning tool and a vegetable brush.  Was that really worth it?  Especially when the unit already took up half your dishwasher every time you used it?In the end, I've returned the Elite.  The plus of the beautifully adjustable slicing disc does't out weight the negatives - mostly the fact that it doesn't completely shred the food and the difficultly of cleaning.WHAT'S A COOK TO DO???  I've looked at other brands and other models (including a Kitchen Aid, which has a nice adjustable slicer but some of the other issues the Elite has).  I love that adjustable slicing disc and several brands are now doing it, but I want one that is a decent size (but not a monster) and easy to clean and that processes all the food.  I'm an optimist.  I'm hoping that someone is going to make this Food Processor before my old Little Pro Plus dies completely.  Here is what I'm looking for (PAY ATTENTION, CUISINART!):1) Size - reasonable.  For me that would be between 3-7 cups.  I don't mind dumping out the shredded food and going back to slice more.  I'd prefer that to having a beast to wash.2) Powerful enough - I don't want a cheap, wimpy motor (both of these were fine in that department)3) Easy to clean, everywhere, every part.  No nooks and crannies to hold gross food particles for all eternity.4) Adjustable slicing disk5) Reversible shredding disk (small and medium)6) Pusher assembly such that one can put foods in while the pusher is still out (this was true for the small pusher on the Elite but not for any part of the Pro Classic)7) chopper8) dough blade9) color choices - personally, I know that die cast is all the rage, but I like white10) SLICES ALL THE FOOD - apparently that has been a problem with a number of Cuisinart models, but it wasn't on the Little Pro Plus.  Cuisinart Design People : go back and pull out your old models.  Look at the Little Pro Plus and figure out what was different and my it doesn't leave so much food unprocessed.  Reproduce that in your next model and then send me an email so I can buy it!HTH.",

I use it almost every day for smoothies, with lots of frozen bananas and crushed ice. The blender never falters and I've never had to stop and push ingredients down towards the blade.  I love the smoothie setting which whirrs for a while then pauses for things to settle, then whirrs again.  In exactly 1 minute, I have a smoothie packed with just what I want.

        "Review": "I've been wanting a pod coffeemaker for some time now. I'm glad I waited to purchase this model. After having it only one day - I used it 6 times for both my daughter and I. The coffee strength is good for prepackaged k-cups and making my k-cups is easy. I ground my own coffee beans fine and weighed about 12 grams of the fine coffee into the mesh basket. I selected the 7.25 oz size and my coffee came out perfectly. I used the my k-cup for tea and hot chocolate too. For my tea, I opened 2 tea bags and finely ground the leaves and then placed them in the basket (basket about 1/2 full) and selected 7.25 oz and my tea came out awesome. I wanted more tea, and I used the same grounds but on the 5.25 setting, and it was another perfect cup! For hot chocolate (Godiva powder) I measured again about 12 grams of fine powder and selected 7.25 oz and again another perfect cup.  I'm pleased with the quality of the taste of prepackaged k-cups and my experiences making my k-cups.This product is very easy to use and it's quiet. The water heats up quickly and you have a cup of whatever you want in less than 20 seconds and clean up is easy. I like that I don't have the hassle of coffee filters, cleaning coffee pots and throwing away coffee I couldn't drink. I enjoy that my guests can choose what they want to drink and that there is always a fresh cup. The bonus is that this product looks great on my countertop. I own other Breville products and can say that their quality is definitely high end.",

If you care to read a few extra details and one very significant point, which should be enough of a reason to have this product taken off the market, then stick around for another minute or two. After decades of brewing consistently excellent coffee via high quality, freshly roasted & ground beans, through a simple Melitta or Chemex pour through setup (ironically the least expensive way to go, assuming you have a stove), life dictated the need for a coffeemaker. I bought this unit from a daily deal site owned by Amazon for slightly more than 1/4 the retail price, so thankfully, my \"investment\" was minimal. What I have come to conclude is that the world of coffeemakers is  nothing more than a variety of compromises. The cheap units like mr. coffee or black & decker don't get hot enough to make a good cup of coffee, any of the non-thermal, glass pot units with a burner underneath scorch the coffee, making it undrinkable in rather short order, and the thermal pots with a spring loaded plunger beneath the filter basket, over the carafe, are all susceptible to varying degrees of spillage, overflow, leaking, and general misbehavior. This unit has exhibited most of the above. The brew temperature topped out at 186 degrees, which is on par with the $20 Mr. Coffee unit. The dreaded overflow of grounds & liquid all over the counter/floor was a regular occurrence. Who cares why? Once is too many times. One shouldn't have to come up with a bunch of workarounds to avoid this. Zero-tolerance for that kind of crap. The carafe leaks from the spout, the top seam, the bottom seam and the lid. As others have said, have your paper towels nearby. Lastly, and this is the real zinger.....I received a pretty strong electrical shock retrieving the pot from the unit. 'Nuff said...time to get rid of this dangerous, poorly made, piece of garbage. It is likely Mr. Puck has never actually seen one of these units bearing his name, much less used one, but if he had, he would certainly think twice about endorsing such a worthless item. He has obviously cashed the check by now...so much for integrity. While all of the different coffeemakers have their pluses and minuses, this one fails miserably across the board.",

This cheap and easy storage container solves all that.  You simply fill it up with coffee then close the lid down while holding the button.  There is a one way valve that pushes the air out while you are pushing down tbut doesnt allow any back in.  So you get a somewhat vacuum seal.  Its not a completely airless container as you can only push out so much air,  but its enough to greatly improve the storage life of your coffee.  I could also see these containers being used for any number of things that you would require an airless environment to lengthen its lifespan.  From sugar, candy, flour, spices, this container would work great.Although it is made of plastic,  it has a great finish and looks great on a counter top.

        "Review": "The Fellowes air purifier works and is a nice air purifier. I have two Winix purifiers and prefer their design and function over this Fellowes unit.Overall, this is a good air purifier, it works exactly as advertised. It removes odors and dust from the room. It works very quietly at idle speed and as it senses odors, it turns up the speed to help remove those odors quickly, all effective and a good thing. From what I can tell, the air purifier companies use the same HEPA filter element to get rid of bacteria, viruses, and dust particles. They also use a similar activated charcoal carbon prefilter to remove odors.October 7, 2013 Update: After using this for a little over two months, I've changed my mind a bit. This air purifier sat in the corner of our kitchen the whole time. The interesting thing, it really does kill odors. Any time we start cooking, the purifier ramps up the fan speed and starts getting rid of the odor in the kitchen. The fan runs fairly fast until the odor is gone (it actually blows air, I can feel the wind). This evening my wife said, who makes this thing? I really like how it clears the air. It does a great job in the kitchen. So, an upgrade to the review. The little design faults are still there, but shoot the thing works.In the end, if these units all remove the same odors and particles and do it quietly, it comes down to small things that separate the good from the great. Here's where I think Fellowes could have done a better job. The design is odd and dated; I'm not a big fan of the rounded on a post look with two side arms that are silver plastic.The filter holder is a flimsy plastic \"drawer\" that slides out of the side of the unit. The carbon filter goes in first then the HEPA filter behind it. Now that carbon filter will be changed about 4 times for every time the HEPA filter needs to be changed. So four times a year, the filter will have to be removed and the carbon filter removed. It would be easier if the carbon filter went on the drawer last.The controls are all touch panels, there are no buttons except the on / off switch at the back of the unit. I had to read the quick start manual to understand what each zone did. The blue lights are horribly bright and large on this thing. They are not dimmable and really can't be covered up since they are switches. And the panel is across the front of the unit.The stand is odd. On good smooth surfaces, the unit will sit still reasonably well. But on slightly uneven floors, the thing is very tippy and spins around easily. It doesn't sit on the floor in a good solid manner. The base doesn't have feet; instead it is a broad flat surface.This thing can blow air. I've never seen an air purifier that can move this much air on manual high speed. If you need a fan that happens to also purify the air, this is a perfect selection. The upper rounded rectangular area is an adjustable vent port, a little like a car vent. I dislike the way this looks, kind of cheap black plastic. And I kind of prefer a fixed air exit that just flows up into the room.I think Winix latest design with the flat white front panel and controls and lamps on the top panel is a much better choice. Fellowes only includes the HEPA filter and one carbon filter in the box. Winix includes a bag of four carbon filters.The full Fellowes owner's manual is not included in the box; it has to be downloaded at their website.Long term use both Fellowes and Winix cost the same amount to run. Except that you have to buy the HEPA filter and carbon filters separately for the Fellowes unit, they come as a kit from Winix.This is a good air purifier. It if is ever on sale or lower price than the Winix, it is a good deal. For me, there are enough little things that I like the Winix better.Four pack of carbon filters (9324101):Fellowes 9324101 4-Pack Carbon Filter for AeraMax 200 Air PurifierHEPA Filter (9287101):True HEPA 9287101 Filter with AeraSafe Antimicrobial Treatment for AeraMax 200 Air PurifierWinix, similar model:Winix FresHome Model P150 True HEPA Air Cleaner with PlasmaWave",

The clock is small and not easy to see, quite easy to use, I am not concerned with it as it makes good coffee and that is what I am after...what good is a fancy clock on a piece of crap coffeemaker? lol. Why it received such back reviews on here is beyond me, it makes a exceptional cup of coffee.",

I purchased this toaster at a discount retailer...Big Lots...and was amazed I could get a four slice bagel toaster for $25 (about the same as it is on Amazon).  The toaster never worked properly from day 1.  It would often not grasp the bread or bagel - you'd push the lever down multiple times to get it to \"catch\".  Then, the darkness knob was irrelevant - didn't matter where you put it - the toast would come out burnt or not done at all - it was just a role of the dice.  This morning my hubby put two pop tarts in the far right two slots, and left the room.  Smoke began billowing throughout the house - the darn thing was on fire!  I am SO GLAD we didn't have our curtains hung up by that window or our whole brand new kitchen would've been on fire...perhaps our house would've gone up in total!  I'll be reporting this to the CPSC; honestly NO ONE should buy Sunbeam products!  Ironically enough, I just returned a Sunbeam space heater I'd purchased this week (it worked fine for one day) because I read the ratings here and how it caught on fire for many people.  Even so I thought, \"I have a Sunbeam toaster - wonder if that's as crappily made?\".  YUP!  There's your answer.  One star is too generous.  BUYER BEWARE!",

Unfortunately it fairly radiates heat, both through the glass door, and especially through the top of the oven, to the extent that I am concerned it will eventually warp or otherwise damage the wooden cabinets above (there is no hazard of fire).  I am not convinced you receive much in the way of energy savings in using it as against a larger but better insulated standard oven.  Some inexpensive insulation would have made all the difference.  We also miss an interior light and a back-lit LCD display.  The esthetics of the unit are fairly basic (we have the 175, brushed chrome version), including rather annoying beepers indicating temperature and timing.  Nonetheless, it is quite useful and a worthwhile appliance, and I am pleased with its performance.  Given its price (...), this is an expensive unit.  As a result, I think the average customer rating is a bit high.  Still, I don't think there is anything better on the market, and I am happy to have it.",

        "Review": "I paid $100 for a this coffee maker and a permanent brew filter.  It worked fine for about two weeks, then it started overflowing, leaking, and now will not brew at all - just sits there blinking 12:00 at me.  The lid to the grounds reservoir snapped off within a week (with the incorporated water filter), during normal handling as I was adding grounds.  You have to open the lid (which is heavy with the soaked water filter) to pour grounds in, the whole contraption is quite awkward and when I dropped it the lid snapped off.You have to be very careful not to overfill the grounds - due to the high speed brew cycle a bunch of water gets dumped in, and having the filter basket more than halfway full will cause the brew basket to overflow and put grounds all over the water filter.  The removable water reservoir is awkward and has a flimsy plastic top set on a pair of spindly plastic pieces that would surely shatter the first time you drop the slippery reservoir, which, like the grounds basket piece, is poorly designed with a hidden handhold in the rear that is off-center and awkward when there's water in it.You have to have a couple feet of clearance all around so as to access the grounds basket and the water reservoir, which are on opposite sides of the large unit.The thermal carafe must be perfectly centered into the receptacle or it will leak.  There always seemed to be some coffee at the base of the carafe or on the unit no matter how careful you were.The thermal carafe has nowhere near the heat retention capability of the zojirushi unit I replaced with this one.When I tried to see what I could do about repairing the unit my only choice it to ship it 75 miles to a repair center at my own expense.I bought it with my Amex card so I am covered on warranty but it is a hassle to deal with the claim and the unit is supposed to work.This unit is made in china junk, pure and simple.  Looks snazzy and well-featured, but in reality is overpriced, cheaply made, and poorly performing.  I was ripped off on this unit.",

        "Review": "I am updating my original review and upgrading this product from 2 stars to FOUR STARS.  The reason for the change is that I got the right charcoal pan from the manufacturer, and now it works much better.Below is my original review of the smoker--to summarize, it came without two of the pans it was supposed to have, and it didn't cook very well.After posting my orignal review, I decided to drill 6 or 8 air holes in the original hole-less charcoal pan, in hopes that the coals would burn better.  I wasn't too thrilled with the result.Now, the manufacturer has sent me the missing charcoal pan and ash pan, and I have used the smoker once more--I cooked a batch of beef that turned out very moist, tender, and tasty.  Having the one hole in the middle of the charcoal pan, as the pan they sent me has, seems to be the trick--the coals burned pretty well, keeping the middle rack around 250-270 degrees F with no water pan (Using the water pan seems to keep the temperature down too low).  The built-in thermometer reads in error about 50 degrees too cool (I checked it against the portable oven thermometer I normally keep in the electric oven).With the right charcoal pan, I am happy with my Brinkmann smoker!  I hope the company gets these cookers out the door with the correct charcoal pan, because when it is set up correctly, it is exactly what it ought to be-- a versatile, competent, straightforward hot smoker for slow cooking practically any piece of meat to perfection.-------------------------Original review-------------------------------------------I bought a large Brinkman charcoal/water smoker the day before the recent holiday weekend. The instructions refer to an 'ash pan' and a 'charcoal pan' and a 'water pan'.  My smoker came with what amounts to two water pans, and no charcoal or pan or ash pan.I think the Brinkman smoker's original design (not what they're now putting in the box) was a tried-and-true design for backyard barbequeing.  In fact, 15 years ago I owned a Smokey Joe  charcoal/water smoker that could have been the prototype for the Brinkman (large cylindrical smoker with charcoal and water pan and two racks). I wouldn't mind owning another Smokey Joe.  Like the Smokey Joe, Brinkman's original design features a couple of porcelain-coated racks sitting above a porcelain-coated pan of water.  Then the water pan sits above a porcelain-coated charcoal pan that has a hole in the bottom of it.  The hole is important! It lets the rising heat of the charcoal draw fresh air into the fire. The hole also let ash fall out from the charcoal pan into the ash pan, which is waiting there to catch them, just below the charcoal pan.  Smokey Joe and Brinkman are nearly identical in all respects of design, or I should say that the Brinkman owner manual describes something very similar to Smokey Joe.Unfortunately, Brinkman did not give us a charcoal pan with a hole in it. They put a white sticker over the picture of the pan in the manual.  Once they decided not to put a hole in the charcoal pan, I guess they decided we wouldn't have much use for an ash pan, either. There is no ash pan in my Brinkman Smoker box.I faxed a request to Brinkman, asking for the missing pans, and scribbled a sympathetic note on the fax asking if they had supplier problems. They didn't respond after 4 business days (they promise a two-day response time). So, I googled 'Brinkman smoker' and read other owners' comments about the pans that are supposed to, but don't, come with the brinkman.  One guy on a blog says he heard that Brinkman had liability issues with the pans because of Brinkman owners' decks catching on fire when owners wisely held their barbeques (on) wooden ground. The coals dropped out of the pan and ignited their decks!But who knows, maybe the truth is something else, like maybe Brinkman infringed on somebody's patented design for a charcoal/water smoker. Gee, what a rip-off to still be selling the design and not even giving buyers the hardware or the means to make it work.So anyway, I used the Brinkman Smoker for a meal during Labor Day weekend,  It was pretty rough trying to get the coals to burn evenly.  I started to drill a big hole or two in the pan, but then recalled the fate of my Smokey Joe--it rusted out.  Drilling holes would leave the pan with no protective porcelain around the edge of the holes.  Drilling would initiate the rot in the charcoal pan.  So I used it as bought, with the Brinkman charcoal/water smoker burning charcoal in a pan with no fresh air inlets under the fire.  The charcoal does burns (start it in a charcoal chimney) but does not burn well for long, because the ahses accumulate in the pan and tend to smother the charcoal.  I found live coals in the ashes of the charcoal pan two days after I smoked the meal!  I almost set my yard on fire by scattering the ash on my wild yard border.As an owner of this ill-conceived smoker, you can look forward to pulling the hot hot charcoal pan out of the smoker every couple of hours and carefully dumping the coals and ash out, and then re-gathering the red hot coals into the pan with fresh charcoal added.  Have some ice handy to sooth any burned skin you get performing this feat.Yes, smoking food in the Brinkman, without the original pan design, is a big drag.  So I called the Brinkman 1-800 number, and listened through their phone menu to where they ask you to send a fax instead of taking time with one of the busy customer service reps on the phone. As requested, I faxed my \"Missing Parts\" request for an ash pan and a charcoal pan. Brinkman says that will reply in email to Missing Parts faxes, within two business days.  I am currently at 4 business days (and two faxes), with no sign that Brinkman intends to live up to their Customer Service promises or to make the charcoal/ash pan problem right.I think I am probably going to shop around for a better value than the Brinkman.  I will return it, used, to the people who sold it to me, since Brinkman apparently isn't even going to respond to my faxes, and I do feel entitled to more value for my money than I got with the Brinkman.The bottom line is that the smoker heat is very hot for a while, and can be adjusted with the vents to cook in the desired heat range, but then it cools w-a-y down as the ashes and the lack of circulating fresh air eventually suffocate the charcoal. I did make smoked meat from the brinkman, but the results were very embarrassing to me as the cook.  The old Smokey Joe did much much better and required only a fraction of the time and effort needed by the Brinkman for the cook to tend the fire, watch the meat, etc.That's my $.02 worth, hope it helps someone make a good decision and get value if they buy a charcoal/water smoker. Good Luck~!",

        "Review": "Imagine engineering teams coming together to build a really good microwave. Then a 10 year old comes along and designs the dial on the panel. This is what comes to mind when you use this microwave for the first time. Instead of a dial knob or buttons to enter the heat time for your microwave (the most basic operation you will use every single time), someone decided it would be cool to use a touch sensitive dial instead. Ok, that is cool if the touch sensor is to only 'touch' and select options. Not when you have to slide your finger along the outer end of the sensor in perfect clockwise circles and pretend you are turning a knob. It is very clunky, error prone and hypersensitive. You end up going too high or too low for the time you are trying to set, then have to reverse your circles till you get it just right. And all I'm trying to do here is set it to 30 seconds and start! Your only other input option is the 'quick minute' button. Overall, it takes much longer to just get your microwave started than it would on even the most basic of microwaves. If you are a 10 year old and like a sci-fi looking dial in blue that glows red next to where your finger touches, this is the microwave for you. But if you are an adult trying to heat your food, this gets old pretty soon. When you're in the kitchen doing other work, you realize that you cannot afford to wash your hands each time to operate this dial (yes, only bare fingers work) and keep sliding your finger in clockwise and anti-clockwise direction till you finally get the number right. I ended up using the 'quick minute' function most of the time and waiting till it hits the time I was really looking for, then stop it. This is ridiculous! Just do what I did - return this and get another Panasonic model without the touch dial. I'm giving it two stars instead of one only because the microwave itself works well and Panasonic's 'inverter' technology is pretty cool when you want to heat food at lower power. If not for the dial, I would give it at least 4 stars. If Panasonic were smart, they would immediately recall this product before people start suing them for carpal tunnel and other repetitive task injuries from using their dial (I'm not kidding, it is strenuous to push a finger down and keep turning it over and over again). All they have to do is swap it out for a traditional knob dial, they're welcome to keep all the pretty glowing lights.",

This machine would have been a 4 star review at this point, but it is NOT made to last too long.The teflon coating began flaking off - and now almost 1/8 of the surface is bare metal.  I cleaned it vigorously to try to remove any loose flakes- but wiping it with a paper towel at any point will net you some very fine particles the same color as the teflon coating.  It isn't oil or burned oil residue - the particles have a slight sparkle/sheen to them.  I am not eager to be a test case for the effects of eating teflon- so into the trash with this product.

        "Review": "Although I bought this kettle at Costco (for $19.99), I wanted to let folks know this may not be a great buy.  Looks nice, boils up quick, all good there.  But, I followed the recommendations that you fill it full, boil it, then reboil 2-3 times.  On the third boiling, even before turning it on to boil, water began leaking out from the lower part of the handle onto the electric stand and started pooling around the base.  Fire hazard to me, so based on poor manufacturing, I cannot recommend it at all.  Taking it back for a refund.",

Things that I have used it for in the past: ice crushing, frozen drinks, pureeing food for baby, and one recipe which consists of softened butter, sugar, eggs, sour cream and ripe bananas.  The other day I was making said recipe and the blender wuold not puree anything.  It then began smoking and stopped.  I have NEVER had good results with this blender and would not recommend it to even the most occasional user.",

        "Review": "I got this NutriBullet from Target - just saying.It's a pretty compact device and comes with three cups and two blades - one for grinding nuts and seeds (milling) and the other for your fruits and veggies.I have a juicer and I love using it but it is large, bulky and I need to make a lot of juice to make it worth while and end up throwing some out because it's only good for about 7 days.This little guy I super - easy to whip up something (I did frozen berries, spinach and an apple) and then clean. Really, I am very happy with it. It makes getting food in you easier and you can learn the right amounts of fruits to use to hide the taste of veggies (if you don't like them).Some tips - add water or milk or whatever liquid or the device won't blend right. You will have to cut up your fruits/veggies (which makes sense). Rinse the blades as soon as you are done so nothing gets sticky on them.",

        "Review": "I have never owned a toaster oven that I actually had to sit and watch the bread toasting like a hawk, ready with tongs to quickly take it out of the oven, because believe me...with this toaster EVERY second counts.  But, it was cute and on sale for 28.00 so the first time it caught on fire I figured it was my fault and thought no more about it. Then my neighbor came over and told me that she had the same exact toaster......with the same exact burn/smoke marks on the right side of the oven (we have the white version with chrome)  Her toaster had caught on fire also (twice), just trying to make some toast.We have both gotten rid of these ovens because they are just too dangerous.  They get unbelievably hot and will melt anything you have near them.  This thing went out the door as soon it cooled down last night. I was heating some taco shells, turned my back for maybe 10 seconds, and this fire started that scared the heck out me because it wouldnt burn itself out (much like the first time) and whenever I would try to open the door the flames would fly out and up very high. With this being under my cabinets it was a horrible experience.  All of that was from trying to heat up two taco shells.When we threw this out, we actually destroyed it not wanting anyone else to go through what we did, or catch their house on fire.  So again, if you already own this, please please be careful.  Dont turn your back on this thing for a second. If you google this you can also read more about fire problems with this oven.",

Krups replaced it. We stayed 3 weeks without a kettle waiting for the shipment. After 2 month it started leaking again! Krups replaced it again. 2 weeks of wait. Now, 3 month passed it is leaking AGAIN! As many other reviewers say, it is a defective model. If not leaked, I would call it below average quality - on/off switch some times turns off right away. It is also quite noisy.Stay away from this kettle and probably from any other kettle made by Krups. Leaking is quite dangerous - it floods the base and may cause a lot of trouble.",

The glass lids of Rival crock pots tend to splinter into dangerous shards, no matter how careful you are. Every time the glass lid makes contact with the crockery -- splinters of glass.  I ordered this crock pot to replace a previously-owned Rival, whose only defect was that the lid was splintering shards -- and BINGO! Even the brand-new one arrived with a tiny chip already in the base of the lid.Rival Corporation, take note:  I replaced this one with a beautiful Hamilton Beach 6-quart, which works just as well, cost a fraction of this price, and has a STEEL-RIMMED GLASS LID that will never be able to splinter glass into our food!",

Initially, I was extremely pleased with this product, however, my husband wished it would have come with a larger cup size because he likes his coffee not so strong. We did not have any problems with the functionality until one day when it simply quit.  We woke up to find the machine's lights off as if it was unplugged.  After a little research on the internet, we learned that they often develop a leak that shorts out the electronics.  I am now left with about 100 worthless K cups, since I refuse to purchase another Keurig.  For $150 I would expect it to last at least 2 years.",

        "Review": "We originally got this popper to have popcorn while we go camping, but we loved the taste of this popcorn so much that it replaced our air popper! Works just as well on a gas or electric burner.The telescopic handle does not feel very secure, but there is an aluminum tab holding it in place. The clean-up isn't too difficult, unless you burn the oil. The theater popcorn that comes with it didn't taste very good...very much like theater popcorn. But, I just poured &lt; 1/2 cup popcorn  (you can also add just 3 kernels of corn, wait for them to pop, then add the rest of the corn) and about 1/4 cup of corn oil (soy oil causes it to be rubbery) with a dash of Lawry's right into the bucket. While you shake the popper over the fire, it mixes perfectly and evenly. No need for butter with the healthier oil.My popcorn isn't as crisp as air popped, but it is sooooo much tastier. It does not get \"rubbery\" (I think there are enough vents, but I usually hold the lid open too, after most of the popcorn has popped). The bucket is also a bowl, just remove the clipped-on top piece, very convenient. Sometimes my arm gets tired while shaking it over a fire or on a burner, it takes 3-5 minutes, depending upon the heat.I am very happy with this product, even though the construction seems a little flimsy.I am going to try kettle corn soon...1/4 cup corn oil, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup corn.Update: After a year of use, the flimsy construction of the handle makes using the popper over a fire risky, the whole kettle might end up in the fire. But, I tend to use it over an electric burner now, if i was to use it over the fire, I would tape or secure the handle (it clips on to the kettle) in some way (sometimes the handle just falls off, the metal clip is bent out of shape). I now downgraded it to 4 stars.",

I am not an expresso drinker, but instead wanted to improve the taste for my drip and french press. My wife was amazed at the difference that it makes. The machine performs well and does make a consistant grind. However in my experience it still has issues with static and can make a mess on your countertop. On the course setting for french press, I don't have an issue with static. But when I try a medium or smaller grind, the static can be pretty bad.However, even with the static issues, I would highly recommend this machine due to the performance and price point. When I get some coffee grounds on the counter, I take out a wet rag and wipe them up.",

For those looking for more reviews, just look at the Weber Q 200, which is a larger version of this grill.Well, here's my short review: this is a fantastic grill.  I live in a New York City apartment with a small balcony, so I needed something small that didn't heat the surroundings too much, yet was hassle free and grilled a great meal.  This produces enough heat to cook steaks perfectly yet remains cool so you're not broiling your table, windows, etc.  There's nothing this grill lacks, and I can't say I miss having a larger, non-portable grill.  The surface area is enough to grill for 2-3 people at a time.  This is also incomparable to the cheap portable grills, which are smaller, flimsy, require an external lighter, unstable, and heat massively (while providing little cooking heat).  If you're considering one of those grills, definitely get this instead.",
